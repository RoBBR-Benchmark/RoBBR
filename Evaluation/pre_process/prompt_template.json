The definition and selection criteria of risk levels for a type of bias: {bias_name}. \n\nYour task is to look through the entire paper and locate text elements that are directly relevant to this bias: {bias_name}. Specifically, you must find information from the paper that is relevant to determining its level (low, unclear or high) of this particular bias: {bias_name}.

Output your reasoning first, and based on your reasoning, make your final selections of text elements. You should only keep the most important text elements. Make sure you do not find more than {text_ele_limit} text elements. If you do, you have to choose the most important {text_ele_limit} elements from it that jointly would provide the greatest amount of information that can support an informed determination of the risk level for this bias: {bias_name}.\n\nFinally, output the list of indices of these text elements in a python list [index1, index2, ...] after the keyword \"DECISION:\"\n",
