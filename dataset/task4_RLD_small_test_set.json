granulomatous scar-forming fibrocalcific constrictive pericarditis so commonly associated with this disease.\nNumerous therapies have previously been investigated as adjuvant strategies in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nColchicine is well described in the treatment of various aetiologies of pericarditis.\nThe aim of this research was to investigate the merit for the use of colchicine in the management of tuberculous pericarditis, specifically to prevent constrictive pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, double-blinded, randomised, control cohort study and was conducted at a secondary level hospital in the Northern Cape of South Africa between August 2013 and December 2015.\nPatients with a probable or definite diagnosis of TB pericarditis were included (n = 33).\nStudy participants with pericardial effusions amenable to pericardiocentesis underwent aspiration until dryness.\nAll patients were treated with standard TB treatment and corticosteroids in accordance with the South African Tuberculosis Treatment Guidelines.\nPatients were randomised to an intervention and control group using a webbased computer system

demonstrable benefit with the use of colchicine was found in terms of prevention of pericardial constriction (p = 0.88, relative risk 1.07, 95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nInterestingly, pericardiocentesis appeared to decrease the incidence of pericardial constriction.\nConclusion\nBased on this research, the use of colchicine in TB pericarditis cannot be advised.\nAdjuvant therapy in the prevention of pericardial constriction is still being investigated and routine pericardiocentesis may prove to be beneficial in this regard.\nIntroduction\nSouth Africa, a land of stark contrasts, contains a diverse natural beauty that can easily be compared with some of the world\u2019s most majestic outdoor scenes.\nOne of the new seven wonders of the natural world, Table Mountain, parades its splendour to the capital of South Africa, Cape Town.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is also considered by many to be one of the tuberculosis (TB) capitals of the world.\nThe incidence of TB in South Africa is estimated to have increased by over 400% in the past 15 years.\nThis is confounded by a staggering co-infection rate of approximately 73% with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nOne of the most dreaded complications of TB pericarditis is pericardial scar formation.\nDue to scarring, the pericardium becomes calcified and contracts over the cardiac chambers, thereby encasing the heart in a fibrocalcific skin that impedes diastolic filling.\nConstrictive pericarditis (CP) is the natural consequence of about 17 to 40% of cases of TB pericardial infection.\nThe definitive treatment of CP is surgical removal of the pericardium, a procedure with a significant peri-operative mortality rate of approximately 15%.\nSouth Africa is on the forefront of research on TB heart disease and has recently published the large, multi-centre IMPI trial.\nOne of the goals of the IMPI trial was to assess the impact of corticosteroids in the management of TB pericarditis.\nThe major findings of the study included (1) corticosteroids had no impact on mortality rates in patients with TB pericarditis, (2) corticosteroids decreased the incidence of pericardial constriction by 46%, and (3) HIV-positive patients who received corticosteroids had a significantly increased risk of developing HIV-associated malignancies.\nIn established TB, early and effective treatment with shortcourse anti-TB therapy is the mainstay of management.\nVarious strategies have been investigated as adjuncts to anti-TB drugs in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nThe ongoing discussions and numerous investigations into a wide array of agents as possible \u2018magic bullets\u2019 in the prevention of pericardial constriction (post-TB infection) illustrates both the interest in the field, and also the lack of a satisfying solution to this problem.\nThe following strategies have previously been evaluated: Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis,6 open surgical drainage (pericardial window), thalidomide, instilling intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapies, and a wide array of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\nNot one of these therapies has, to date, been internationally recognised as an acceptable standard of therapy, and the choice of adjuvant treatment varies significantly among experts in the field.\nColchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation.\nIt acts by binding to tubulin and is registered for the acute treatment of gout crystal arthropathies.\nThe plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described as treatment for arthritis in the Ebers Papyrus in 1500 BC.\nIn modern medicine, colchicine has however played a wider role in the treatment of pericarditis of various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in the Northern Cape province of South Africa at a secondary-level hospital in Kimberley between August 2013 and April 2015.\nThe research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of the Free State and the study was registered with the National Health Research Committee.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, doubleblind, randomised, control cohort.\nAll patients presenting to the Kimberley Hospital complex (KHC) with pericardial effusions were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn the absence of contra-indications, patients underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis if the procedure was deemed safe and possible.\nStandard therapy was initiated in accordance with the South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines:14 weight-adjusted anti-TB drugs (Rifafourf\u00ae) and oral corticosteroids.\n(prednisone: 1.5 mg/kg per day for four weeks; 1.0 mg/kg per day for two weeks; 0.5 mg/kg per day for one week; 0.25 mg/kg per day for one week).\nHIV co-infected patients not previously on treatment were initiated on fixeddose combination (FDC) antiretroviral treatment six weeks after initiation of TB treatment (FDC: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg, Emtricitabine 200 mg and Efavirenz 600 mg).\nPatients were randomly assigned to the intervention group with the use of a web-based randomisation system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine (dose 1.0 mg per day) for a total of six weeks, whereas the control group received a placebo for the same period (Fig. 1).\nPatients subsequently underwent serial echocardiographic examinations on an out-patient basis and adherence checks, including pill counts, were done at follow-up visits.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction and this diagnosis was made echocardiographically at four months post initial presentation.\nUpon completion of the follow-up period of all patients, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nTwo groups of patients were included: (1) definite TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured that no features of constriction were present at the time of enrolment in the study.\nFollow-up echocardiograms were performed four months after the initiation of therapy.\nThe echocardiograms were performed and co-reviewed by two experienced echocardiographers (who had both attended a dedicated workshop at a tertiary-level academic hospital aimed at the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP).\nA GE Vivid E6\u00ae ultrasound machine was used to perform a systematic examination according to the basic minimum standards as stipulated by the British Society of Echocardiography.\nNumerous other echocardiographic parameters were assessed, including the presence of a septal shudder, respiratophasic septal shift, left atrial enlargement and echocardiographic features of pericardial thickening (Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an additional three passed away during the follow-up period.\nIn-patient deaths were due to neutropenic sepsis, cerebrovascular incident and nosocomial pneumonia, respectively.\nIn all out-patient deaths, the cause was undetermined.\nFive patients were lost to follow up and one patient was removed from the study due to presumed drug side effects.\nA total of 21 patients completed the follow-up period (Fig. 5).\nThe study population had a female preponderance (66% females) and the mean age of the studied patients was 31 years.\nDisseminated pericardial tuberculosis was found to be a disease exclusive to the immune-compromised in this cohort; all 21 patients were HIV positive.\nThe median CD4+ count was 162 and 346 cells/mm3 in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively.\nOf the 21 eligible participants, 12 had been assigned to the treatment group and the remaining nine were in the placebo group.\nThe diagnosis of definite pericardial tuberculosis was made in 23.8% of the patients, while the remaining 76.2% were diagnosed on the basis of suggestive clinical and biochemical features (see inclusion criteria).\nOf the studied patients, 47.6% underwent pericardiocentesis, whereas the remaining 52.4% could not undergo safe pericardiocentesis.\nThe average volume of fluid drained via single pericardial aspiration was 622 ml.\nThe macroscopic appearance of the fluid varied from serosanguineous to haemorrhagic, reflecting the different pathological stages of development.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis was proven on pericardial aspirates in 50% of cases, either by positive culture (30%) or by direct PCR technique (Gene Xpert) (20%) (Table 2).\nPericardial constriction is the natural sequela of approximately 17 to 40% of TB pericardial infections.\nIn our cohort, the incidence of pericardial constriction (demonstrated by echocardiography) four months after the initial diagnosis was 23.8%.\nOf the five patients who developed pericardial constriction, two were in the control group and the remaining three were in the group treated with colchicine.\nOf those who did not develop pericardial constriction, nine were in the colchicine group and seven were in the placebo group.\nThe data from Table 3 yields a p-value of 0.88.\nThe relative risk for developing constriction in the colchicine group compared to the intervention group was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nThere was therefore no statistically demonstrable correlation between the use of colchicine and pericardial constriction in this study cohort.\nThe side effects among the patients using colchicine were usually minor; 56% of the initial 19 patients who were in the colchicine group reported self-limiting diarrhoea during their hospital stay.\nSerious side effects were observed in one patient who developed hepatitis during his course of treatment.\nThe patient was removed from the study and daily liver function testing showed a rapid recovery.\nAlthough the study was neither empowered nor designed to evaluate the effect of pericardiocentesis on the subsequent development of pericardial constriction, a very apparent and interesting finding was observed.\nWe found that, with the exception of one patient, all those who developed pericardial constriction were in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis.\nConversely, in the group that underwent pericardiocentesis, only one participant developed pericardial constriction.\nPericardiocentesis therefore seemed to be very effective in the prevention of pericardial constriction and in this cohort only one patient (10%) who underwent pericardiocentesis developed constriction.\nThese findings are observational and disregard the initial group allocations.\nDiscussion\nThe proverbial \u2018eureka moment\u2019 in the management of TB pericarditis seems to be elusive.\nNumerous interventions have been postulated and investigated in an attempt to prevent the devastating post-inflammatory changes in the pericardium following TB pericarditis.\nIn this pilot study, the merit of adding colchicine to the current management guidelines was investigated in a systematic manner.\nAs all the participants of this study were HIV positive, the findings can only be applied to this subgroup of patients with TB pericarditis.\nThere was a notable difference in the median CD4+ lymphocyte count between the treatment and placebo groups, but when assessed as an independent variable, no correlation could be demonstrated between degree of immunocompetency, as measured by CD4+ count, and the risk for development of constriction.\nThis pilot study could not demonstrate any benefit derived from the addition of colchicine to the routine management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe power of this pilot trial was insufficient to detect small differences in outcome; however, it appears that colchicine use has no correlation with the prevention or formation of post-TB CP.\nThis pilot trial could not assess the beneficial effects of colchicine in the HIV-negative patient with TB pericarditis.\nAfter considering the findings of this pilot research, the costs of the drug, the polypharmacy these patients are exposed to, drug\u2013drug interactions and side effects (albeit mild), this study would advise against the use of colchicine in the management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe implementation of a pericardiocentesis until dryness (with or without extended drainage) was up to this point never studied in a controlled or comparative manner.\nResearch conducted by Reuter et al. in 2007 found the first evidence to suggest the benefit of a pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage.\nIn their research, 162 patients with TB pericarditis underwent pericardiocentesis, and over a followup period of six years, only two patients (1.23%) developed fibrous pericardial constriction.\nThe research concluded that echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis with extended drainage is a safe and effective management option, and when combined with short-course anti-tuberculous therapy, it almost completely prevents the development of CP.\nA few leading centres are employing a routine \u2018pericardiocentesis until dryness\u2019 approach based on this literature, whereas most do not.\nThe interesting observation made in our pilot study was that the findings made by Reuters et al. in 2007 were reproducible on a much smaller scale.\nPericardial constriction, although having a low incidence, was almost exclusively seen in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis (observational \u2013 disregard original group allocation).\nAs suggested by some expert opinion and as supported by the data published by Reuters et al. and observational findings of our pilot trial, the practice of routine pericardiocentesis until dryness in the absence of contraindications appears to be the preferred management option and this might well be the long-awaited \u2018eureka moment\u2019, in an attempt to halt the development of pericardial constriction.\nLinitations of the study\nThe diagnosis of pericardial constriction was made with echocardiography, whereas the gold standard for diagnosing CP is invasive haemodynamic studies.\nWork done by Oh et al. and Boonyaratevej et al. demonstrated that one of the most characteristic findings of CP, a respiratory variation in early transmittal inflow velocity, is neither perfect in its sensitivity nor specificity for the diagnosis.\nIn patients with markedly elevated left atrial pressures, the respiratory variation in the inflow velocities may be less than 25%.\nFurthermore, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe right ventricular dysfunction, the variation may be elevated in the absence of CP.\nThis research emphasises the importance of using a variety of recognised echocardiographic diagnostic tools to confirm a non-invasive diagnosis of CP.\nThe duration of follow up was only four months.\nSome comparative research had follow-up periods of up to six years.\nMost patients who develop CP, do so in a period of three to four months.\nThere may however be patients who will only develop constriction after four months.\nResearch to address this aspect may be valuable.\nCorticosteroids were used as part of the standard therapy in all patients.\nHowever, subsequent to the initiation of the research, the IMPI trial brought to light their findings that corticosteroids should not be used in TB pericarditis in HIV-infected patients.\nThe South African National TB guidelines published in 2014 still advised the use of corticosteroids in all patients and the findings of the IMPI trial had not yet been incorporated into current South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines.\nConclusion\nBased on current research, the use of colchicine in addition to standard antituberculous therapy cannot be advised in the context of TB pericarditis in the HIV-positive population.\nThe jury is still out on which adjuvant strategies may prove to be beneficial in the prevention of CP, especially in the HIV-coinfected subgroup.\nBased on observations from this research and some other studies, routine pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage may prove to be the long-awaited solution to the common dilemma of post-TB CP.\nFlow diagram illustrating study methodology.\nA.

TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured that no features of constriction were present at the time of enrolment in the study.\nFollow-up echocardiograms were performed four months after the initiation of therapy.\nThe echocardiograms were performed and co-reviewed by two experienced echocardiographers (who had both attended a dedicated workshop at a tertiary-level academic hospital aimed at the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP).\nA GE Vivid E6\u00ae ultrasound machine was used to perform a systematic examination according to the basic minimum standards as stipulated by the British Society of Echocardiography.\nNumerous other echocardiographic parameters were assessed, including the presence of a septal shudder, respiratophasic septal shift, left atrial enlargement and echocardiographic features of pericardial thickening (Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an additional three passed away during the follow-up period.\nIn-patient deaths were due to neutropenic sepsis, cerebrovascular incident and nosocomial pneumonia, respectively.\nIn all out-patient deaths, the cause was undetermined.\nFive patients were lost to follow up and one patient was removed from the study due to presumed drug side effects.\nA total of 21 patients completed the follow-up period (Fig. 5).\nThe study population had a female preponderance (66% females) and the mean age of the studied patients was 31 years.\nDisseminated pericardial tuberculosis was found to be a disease exclusive to the immune-compromised in this cohort; all 21 patients were HIV positive.\nThe median CD4+ count was 162 and 346 cells/mm3 in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively.\nOf the 21 eligible participants, 12 had been assigned to the treatment group and the remaining nine were in the placebo group.\nThe diagnosis of definite pericardial tuberculosis was made in 23.8% of the patients, while the remaining 76.2% were diagnosed on the basis of suggestive clinical and biochemical features (see inclusion criteria).\nOf the studied patients, 47.6% underwent pericardiocentesis, whereas the remaining 52.4% could not undergo safe pericardiocentesis.\nThe average volume of fluid drained via single pericardial aspiration was 622 ml.\nThe macroscopic appearance of the fluid varied from serosanguineous to haemorrhagic, reflecting the different pathological stages of development.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis was proven on pericardial aspirates in 50% of cases, either by positive culture (30%) or by direct PCR technique (Gene Xpert) (20%) (Table 2).\nPericardial constriction is the natural sequela of approximately 17 to 40% of TB pericardial infections.\nIn our cohort, the incidence of pericardial constriction (demonstrated by echocardiography) four months after the initial diagnosis was 23.8%.\nOf the five patients who developed pericardial constriction, two were in the control group and the remaining three were in the group treated with colchicine.\nOf those who did not develop pericardial constriction, nine were in the colchicine group and seven were in the placebo group.\nThe data from Table 3 yields a p-value of 0.88.\nThe relative risk for developing constriction in the colchicine group compared to the intervention group was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nThere was therefore no statistically demonstrable correlation between the use of colchicine and pericardial constriction in this study cohort.\nThe side effects among the patients using colchicine were usually minor; 56% of the initial 19 patients who were in the colchicine group reported self-limiting diarrhoea during their hospital stay.\nSerious side effects were observed in one patient who developed hepatitis during his course of treatment.\nThe patient was removed from the study and daily liver function testing showed a rapid recovery.\nAlthough the study was neither empowered nor designed to evaluate the effect of pericardiocentesis on the subsequent development of pericardial constriction, a very apparent and interesting finding was observed.\nWe found that, with the exception of one patient, all those who developed pericardial constriction were in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis.\nConversely, in the group that underwent pericardiocentesis, only one participant developed pericardial constriction.\nPericardiocentesis therefore seemed to be very effective in the prevention of pericardial constriction and in this cohort only one patient (10%) who underwent pericardiocentesis developed constriction.\nThese findings are observational and disregard the initial group allocations.\nDiscussion\nThe proverbial \u2018eureka moment\u2019 in the management of TB pericarditis seems to be elusive.\nNumerous interventions have been postulated and investigated in an attempt to prevent the devastating post-inflammatory changes in the pericardium following TB pericarditis.\nIn this pilot study, the merit of adding colchicine to the current management guidelines was investigated in a systematic manner.\nAs all the participants of this study were HIV positive, the findings can only be applied to this subgroup of patients with TB pericarditis.\nThere was a notable difference in the median CD4+ lymphocyte count between the treatment and placebo groups, but when assessed as an independent variable, no correlation could be demonstrated between degree of immunocompetency, as measured by CD4+ count, and the risk for development of constriction.\nThis pilot study could not demonstrate any benefit derived from the addition of colchicine to the routine management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe power of this pilot trial was insufficient to detect small differences in outcome; however, it appears that colchicine use has no correlation with the prevention or formation of post-TB CP.\nThis pilot trial could not assess the beneficial effects of colchicine in the HIV-negative patient with TB pericarditis.\nAfter considering the findings of this pilot research, the costs of the drug, the polypharmacy these patients are exposed to, drug\u2013drug interactions and side effects (albeit mild), this study would advise against the use of colchicine in the management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe implementation of a pericardiocentesis until dryness (with or without extended drainage) was up to this point never studied in a controlled or comparative manner.\nResearch conducted by Reuter et al. in 2007 found the first evidence to suggest the benefit of a pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage.\nIn their research, 162 patients with TB pericarditis underwent pericardiocentesis, and over a followup period of six years, only two patients (1.23%) developed fibrous pericardial constriction.\nThe research concluded that echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis with extended drainage is a safe and effective management option, and when combined with short-course anti-tuberculous therapy, it almost completely prevents the development of CP.\nA few leading centres are employing a routine \u2018pericardiocentesis until dryness\u2019 approach based on this literature, whereas most do not.\nThe interesting observation made in our pilot study was that the findings made by Reuters et al. in 2007 were reproducible on a much smaller scale.\nPericardial constriction, although having a low incidence, was almost exclusively seen in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis (observational \u2013 disregard original group allocation).\nAs suggested by some expert opinion and as supported by the data published by Reuters et al. and observational findings of our pilot trial, the practice of routine pericardiocentesis until dryness in the absence of contraindications appears to be the preferred management option and this might well be the long-awaited \u2018eureka moment\u2019, in an attempt to halt the development of pericardial constriction.\nLinitations of the study\nThe diagnosis of pericardial constriction was made with echocardiography, whereas the gold standard for diagnosing CP is invasive haemodynamic studies.\nWork done by Oh et al. and Boonyaratevej et al. demonstrated that one of the most characteristic findings of CP, a respiratory variation in early transmittal inflow velocity, is neither perfect in its sensitivity nor specificity for the diagnosis.\nIn patients with markedly elevated left atrial pressures, the respiratory variation in the inflow velocities may be less than 25%.\nFurthermore, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe right ventricular dysfunction, the variation may be elevated in the absence of CP.\nThis research emphasises the importance of using a variety of recognised echocardiographic diagnostic tools to confirm a non-invasive diagnosis of CP.\nThe duration of follow up was only four months.\nSome comparative research had follow-up periods of up to six years.\nMost patients who develop CP, do so in a period of three to four months.\nThere may however be patients who will only develop constriction after four months.\nResearch to address this aspect may be valuable.\nCorticosteroids were used as part of the standard therapy in all patients.\nHowever, subsequent to the initiation of the research, the IMPI trial brought to light their findings that corticosteroids should not be used in TB pericarditis in HIV-infected patients.\nThe South African National TB guidelines published in 2014 still advised the use of corticosteroids in all patients and the findings of the IMPI trial had not yet been incorporated into current South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines.\nConclusion\nBased on current research, the use of colchicine in addition to standard antituberculous therapy cannot be advised in the context of TB pericarditis in the HIV-positive population.\nThe jury is still out on which adjuvant strategies may prove to be beneficial in the prevention of CP, especially in the HIV-coinfected subgroup.\nBased on observations from this research and some other studies, routine pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage may prove to be the long-awaited solution to the common dilemma of post-TB CP.\nFlow diagram illustrating study methodology.\nA.

granulomatous scar-forming fibrocalcific constrictive pericarditis so commonly associated with this disease.\nNumerous therapies have previously been investigated as adjuvant strategies in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nColchicine is well described in the treatment of various aetiologies of pericarditis.\nThe aim of this research was to investigate the merit for the use of colchicine in the management of tuberculous pericarditis, specifically to prevent constrictive pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, double-blinded, randomised, control cohort study and was conducted at a secondary level hospital in the Northern Cape of South Africa between August 2013 and December 2015.\nPatients with a probable or definite diagnosis of TB pericarditis were included (n = 33).\nStudy participants with pericardial effusions amenable to pericardiocentesis underwent aspiration until dryness.\nAll patients were treated with standard TB treatment and corticosteroids in accordance with the South African Tuberculosis Treatment Guidelines.\nPatients were randomised to an intervention and control group using a webbased computer system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine 1.0 mg per day for six weeks and the control group received a placebo for the same period.\nPatients were followed up with serial echocardiography for 16 weeks.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction.\nUpon completion of the research period, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nResults\nTB pericarditis was found exclusively in HIV-positive individuals.\nThe incidence of pericardial constriction in our cohort was 23.8%.\nNo demonstrable benefit with the use of colchicine was found in terms of prevention of pericardial constriction (p = 0.88, relative risk 1.07, 95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nInterestingly, pericardiocentesis appeared to decrease the incidence of pericardial constriction.\nConclusion\nBased on this research, the use of colchicine in TB pericarditis cannot be advised.\nAdjuvant therapy in the prevention of pericardial constriction is still being investigated and routine pericardiocentesis may prove to be beneficial in this regard.\nIntroduction\nSouth Africa, a land of stark contrasts, contains a diverse natural beauty that can easily be compared with some of the world\u2019s most majestic outdoor scenes.\nOne of the new seven wonders of the natural world, Table Mountain, parades its splendour to the capital of South Africa, Cape Town.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is also considered by many to be one of the tuberculosis (TB) capitals of the world.\nThe incidence of TB in South Africa is estimated to have increased by over 400% in the past 15 years.\nThis is confounded by a staggering co-infection rate of approximately 73% with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nOne of the most dreaded complications of TB pericarditis is pericardial scar formation.\nDue to scarring, the pericardium becomes calcified and contracts over the cardiac chambers, thereby encasing the heart in a fibrocalcific skin that impedes diastolic filling.\nConstrictive pericarditis (CP) is the natural consequence of about 17 to 40% of cases of TB pericardial infection.\nThe definitive treatment of CP is surgical removal of the pericardium, a procedure with a significant peri-operative mortality rate of approximately 15%.\nSouth Africa is on the forefront of research on TB heart disease and has recently published the large, multi-centre IMPI trial.\nOne of the goals of the IMPI trial was to assess the impact of corticosteroids in the management of TB pericarditis.\nThe major findings of the study included (1) corticosteroids had no impact on mortality rates in patients with TB pericarditis, (2) corticosteroids decreased the incidence of pericardial constriction by 46%, and (3) HIV-positive patients who received corticosteroids had a significantly increased risk of developing HIV-associated malignancies.\nIn established TB, early and effective treatment with shortcourse anti-TB therapy is the mainstay of management.\nVarious strategies have been investigated as adjuncts to anti-TB drugs in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nThe ongoing discussions and numerous investigations into a wide array of agents as possible \u2018magic bullets\u2019 in the prevention of pericardial constriction (post-TB infection) illustrates both the interest in the field, and also the lack of a satisfying solution to this problem.\nThe following strategies have previously been evaluated: Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis,6 open surgical drainage (pericardial window), thalidomide, instilling intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapies, and a wide array of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\nNot one of these therapies has, to date, been internationally recognised as an acceptable standard of therapy, and the choice of adjuvant treatment varies significantly among experts in the field.\nColchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation.\nIt acts by binding to tubulin and is registered for the acute treatment of gout crystal arthropathies.\nThe plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described as treatment for arthritis in the Ebers Papyrus in 1500 BC.\nIn modern medicine, colchicine has however played a wider role in the treatment of pericarditis of various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in the Northern Cape province of South Africa at a secondary-level hospital in Kimberley between August 2013 and April 2015.\nThe research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of the Free State and the study was registered with the National Health Research Committee.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, doubleblind, randomised, control cohort.\nAll patients presenting to the Kimberley Hospital complex (KHC) with pericardial effusions were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn the absence of contra-indications, patients underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis if the procedure was deemed safe and possible.\nStandard therapy was initiated in accordance with the South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines:14 weight-adjusted anti-TB drugs (Rifafourf\u00ae) and oral corticosteroids.\n(prednisone: 1.5 mg/kg per day for four weeks; 1.0 mg/kg per day for two weeks; 0.5 mg/kg per day for one week; 0.25 mg/kg per day for one week).\nHIV co-infected patients not previously on treatment were initiated on fixeddose combination (FDC) antiretroviral treatment six weeks after initiation of TB treatment (FDC: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg, Emtricitabine 200 mg and Efavirenz 600 mg).\nPatients were randomly assigned to the intervention group with the use of a web-based randomisation system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine (dose 1.0 mg per day) for a total of six weeks, whereas the control group received a placebo for the same period (Fig. 1).\nPatients subsequently underwent serial echocardiographic examinations on an out-patient basis and adherence checks, including pill counts, were done at follow-up visits.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction and this diagnosis was made echocardiographically at four months post initial presentation.\nUpon completion of the follow-up period of all patients, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nTwo groups of patients were included: (1) definite TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured

(Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an

diverse natural beauty that can easily be compared with some of the world\u2019s most majestic outdoor scenes.\nOne of the new seven wonders of the natural world, Table Mountain, parades its splendour to the capital of South Africa, Cape Town.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is also considered by many to be one of the tuberculosis (TB) capitals of the world.\nThe incidence of TB in South Africa is estimated to have increased by over 400% in the past 15 years.\nThis is confounded by a staggering co-infection rate of approximately 73% with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nOne of the most dreaded complications of TB pericarditis is pericardial scar formation.\nDue to scarring, the pericardium becomes calcified and contracts over the cardiac chambers, thereby encasing the heart in a fibrocalcific skin that impedes diastolic filling.\nConstrictive pericarditis (CP) is the natural consequence of about 17 to 40% of cases of TB pericardial infection.\nThe definitive treatment of CP is surgical removal of the pericardium, a procedure with a significant peri-operative mortality rate of approximately 15%.\nSouth Africa is on the forefront of research on TB heart disease and has recently published the large, multi-centre IMPI trial.\nOne of the goals of the IMPI trial was to assess the impact of corticosteroids in the management of TB pericarditis.\nThe major findings of the study included (1) corticosteroids had no impact on mortality rates in patients with TB pericarditis, (2) corticosteroids decreased the incidence of pericardial constriction by 46%, and (3) HIV-positive patients who received corticosteroids had a significantly increased risk of developing HIV-associated malignancies.\nIn established TB, early and effective treatment with shortcourse anti-TB therapy is the mainstay of management.\nVarious strategies have been investigated as adjuncts to anti-TB drugs in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nThe ongoing discussions and numerous investigations into a wide array of agents as possible \u2018magic bullets\u2019 in the prevention of pericardial constriction (post-TB infection) illustrates both the interest in the field, and also the lack of a satisfying solution to this problem.\nThe following strategies have previously been evaluated: Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis,6 open surgical drainage (pericardial window), thalidomide, instilling intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapies, and a wide array of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\nNot one of these therapies has, to date, been internationally recognised as an acceptable standard of therapy, and the choice of adjuvant treatment varies significantly among experts in the field.\nColchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation.\nIt acts by binding to tubulin and is registered for the acute treatment of gout crystal arthropathies.\nThe plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described as treatment for arthritis in the Ebers Papyrus in 1500 BC.\nIn modern medicine, colchicine has however played a wider role in the treatment of pericarditis of various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in the Northern Cape province of South Africa at a secondary-level hospital in Kimberley between August 2013 and April 2015.\nThe research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of the Free State and the study was registered with the National Health Research Committee.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, doubleblind, randomised, control cohort.\nAll patients presenting to the Kimberley Hospital complex (KHC) with pericardial effusions were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn the absence of contra-indications, patients underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis if the procedure was deemed safe and possible.\nStandard therapy was initiated in accordance with the South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines:14 weight-adjusted anti-TB drugs (Rifafourf\u00ae) and oral corticosteroids.\n(prednisone: 1.5 mg/kg per day for four weeks; 1.0 mg/kg per day for two weeks; 0.5 mg/kg per day for one week; 0.25 mg/kg per day for one week).\nHIV co-infected patients not previously on treatment were initiated on fixeddose combination (FDC) antiretroviral treatment six weeks after initiation of TB treatment (FDC: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg, Emtricitabine 200 mg and Efavirenz 600 mg).\nPatients were randomly assigned to the intervention group with the use of a web-based randomisation system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine (dose 1.0 mg per day) for a total of six weeks, whereas the control group received a placebo for the same period (Fig. 1).\nPatients subsequently underwent serial echocardiographic examinations on an out-patient basis and adherence checks, including pill counts, were done at follow-up visits.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction and this diagnosis was made echocardiographically at four months post initial presentation.\nUpon completion of the follow-up period of all patients, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nTwo groups of patients were included: (1) definite TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured that no features of constriction were present at the time of enrolment in the study.\nFollow-up echocardiograms were performed four months after the initiation of therapy.\nThe echocardiograms were performed and co-reviewed by two experienced echocardiographers (who had both attended a dedicated workshop at a tertiary-level academic hospital aimed at the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP).\nA GE Vivid E6\u00ae ultrasound machine was used to perform a systematic examination according to the basic minimum standards as stipulated by the British Society of Echocardiography.\nNumerous other echocardiographic parameters were assessed, including the presence of a septal shudder, respiratophasic septal shift, left atrial enlargement and echocardiographic features of pericardial thickening (Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an additional three passed away during the follow-up period.\nIn-patient deaths were due to neutropenic sepsis, cerebrovascular incident and nosocomial pneumonia, respectively.\nIn all out-patient deaths, the cause was undetermined.\nFive patients were lost to follow up and one patient was removed from the study due to presumed drug side effects.\nA total of 21 patients completed the follow-up period (Fig. 5).\nThe study population had a female preponderance (66% females) and the mean age of the studied patients was 31 years.\nDisseminated pericardial tuberculosis was found to be a disease exclusive to the immune-compromised in this cohort; all 21 patients were HIV positive.\nThe median CD4+ count was 162 and 346 cells/mm3 in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively.\nOf the 21 eligible participants, 12 had been assigned to the treatment group and the remaining nine were in the placebo group.\nThe diagnosis of definite pericardial tuberculosis was made in 23.8% of the patients, while the remaining 76.2% were diagnosed on the basis of suggestive clinical and biochemical features (see inclusion criteria).\nOf the studied patients, 47.6% underwent pericardiocentesis, whereas the remaining 52.4% could not undergo safe pericardiocentesis.\nThe average volume of fluid drained via single pericardial aspiration was 622 ml.\nThe macroscopic appearance of the fluid varied from serosanguineous to haemorrhagic, reflecting the different pathological stages of development.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis was proven on pericardial aspirates in 50% of cases, either by positive culture (30%) or by direct PCR technique (Gene Xpert) (20%) (Table 2).\nPericardial constriction is the natural sequela of approximately 17 to 40% of TB pericardial infections.\nIn our cohort, the incidence of pericardial constriction (demonstrated by echocardiography) four months after the initial diagnosis was 23.8%.\nOf the five patients who developed pericardial constriction, two were in the control group and the remaining three were in the group treated with colchicine.\nOf those who did not develop pericardial constriction, nine were in the colchicine group and seven were in the placebo group.\nThe data from Table 3 yields a p-value of 0.88.\nThe relative risk for developing constriction in the colchicine group compared to the intervention group was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nThere was therefore no statistically demonstrable correlation between the use of colchicine and pericardial constriction in this study cohort.\nThe side effects among the patients using colchicine were usually minor; 56% of the initial 19 patients who were in the colchicine group reported self-limiting diarrhoea during their hospital stay.\nSerious side effects were observed in one patient who developed hepatitis during his course of treatment.\nThe patient was removed from the study and daily liver function testing showed a rapid recovery.\nAlthough the study was neither empowered nor designed to evaluate the effect of pericardiocentesis on the subsequent development of pericardial constriction, a very apparent and interesting finding was observed.\nWe found that, with the exception of one patient, all those who developed pericardial constriction were in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis.\nConversely, in the group that underwent pericardiocentesis, only one participant developed pericardial constriction.\nPericardiocentesis therefore seemed to be very effective in the prevention of pericardial constriction and in this cohort only one patient (10%) who underwent pericardiocentesis developed constriction.\nThese findings are observational and disregard the initial group allocations.\nDiscussion\nThe proverbial \u2018eureka moment\u2019 in the management of TB pericarditis seems to be elusive.\nNumerous interventions have been postulated and investigated in an attempt to prevent the devastating post-inflammatory changes in the pericardium following TB pericarditis.\nIn this pilot study, the merit of adding colchicine to the current management guidelines was investigated in a systematic manner.\nAs all the participants of this study were HIV positive, the findings can only be applied to this subgroup of patients with TB pericarditis.\nThere was a notable difference in the median CD4+ lymphocyte count between the treatment and placebo groups, but when assessed as an independent variable, no correlation could be demonstrated between degree of immunocompetency, as measured by CD4+ count, and the risk for development of constriction.\nThis pilot study could not demonstrate any benefit derived from the addition of colchicine to the routine management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe power of this pilot trial was insufficient to detect small differences in outcome; however, it appears that colchicine use has no correlation with the prevention or formation of post-TB CP.\nThis pilot trial could not assess the beneficial effects of colchicine in the HIV-negative patient with TB pericarditis.\nAfter considering the findings of this pilot research, the costs of the drug, the polypharmacy these patients are exposed to, drug\u2013drug interactions and side effects (albeit mild), this study would advise against the use of colchicine in the management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe implementation of a pericardiocentesis until dryness (with or without extended drainage) was up to this point never studied in a controlled or comparative manner.\nResearch conducted by Reuter et al. in 2007 found the first evidence to suggest the benefit of a pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage.\nIn their research, 162 patients with TB pericarditis underwent pericardiocentesis, and over a followup period of six years, only two patients (1.23%) developed fibrous pericardial constriction.\nThe research concluded that echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis with extended drainage is a safe and effective management option, and when combined with short-course anti-tuberculous therapy, it almost completely prevents the development of CP.\nA few leading centres are employing a routine \u2018pericardiocentesis until dryness\u2019 approach based on this literature, whereas most do not.\nThe interesting observation made in our pilot study was that the findings made by Reuters et al. in 2007 were reproducible on a much smaller scale.\nPericardial constriction, although having a low incidence, was almost exclusively seen in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis (observational \u2013 disregard original group allocation).\nAs suggested by some expert opinion and as supported by the data published by Reuters et al. and observational findings of our pilot trial, the practice of routine pericardiocentesis until dryness in the absence of contraindications appears to be the preferred management option and this might well be the long-awaited \u2018eureka moment\u2019, in an attempt to halt the development of pericardial constriction.\nLinitations of the study\nThe diagnosis of pericardial constriction was made with echocardiography, whereas the gold standard for diagnosing CP is invasive haemodynamic studies.\nWork done by Oh et al. and Boonyaratevej et al. demonstrated that one of the most characteristic findings of CP, a respiratory variation in early transmittal inflow velocity, is neither perfect in its sensitivity nor specificity for the diagnosis.\nIn patients with markedly elevated left atrial pressures, the respiratory variation in the inflow velocities may be less than 25%.\nFurthermore, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe right ventricular dysfunction, the variation may be elevated in the absence of CP.\nThis research emphasises the importance of using a variety of recognised echocardiographic diagnostic tools to confirm a non-invasive diagnosis of CP.\nThe duration of follow up was only four months.\nSome comparative research had follow-up periods of up to six years.\nMost patients who develop CP, do so in a period of three to four months.\nThere may however be patients who will only develop constriction after four months.\nResearch to address this aspect may be valuable.\nCorticosteroids were used as part of the standard therapy in all patients.\nHowever, subsequent to the initiation of the research, the IMPI trial brought to light their findings that corticosteroids should not be used in TB pericarditis in HIV-infected patients.\nThe South African National TB guidelines published in 2014 still advised the use of corticosteroids in all patients and the findings of the IMPI trial had not yet been incorporated into current South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines.\nConclusion\nBased on current research, the use of colchicine in addition to standard antituberculous therapy cannot be advised in the context of TB pericarditis in the HIV-positive population.\nThe jury is still out on which adjuvant strategies may prove to be beneficial in the prevention of CP, especially in the HIV-coinfected subgroup.\nBased on observations from this research and some other studies, routine pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage may prove to be the long-awaited solution to the common dilemma of post-TB CP.\nFlow diagram illustrating study methodology.\nA.

various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in the Northern Cape province of South Africa at a secondary-level hospital in Kimberley between August 2013 and April 2015.\nThe research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of the Free State and the study was registered with the National Health Research Committee.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, doubleblind, randomised, control cohort.\nAll patients presenting to the Kimberley Hospital complex (KHC) with pericardial effusions were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn the absence of contra-indications, patients underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis if the procedure was deemed safe and possible.\nStandard therapy was initiated in accordance with the South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines:14 weight-adjusted anti-TB drugs (Rifafourf\u00ae) and oral corticosteroids.\n(prednisone: 1.5 mg/kg per day for four weeks; 1.0 mg/kg per day for two weeks; 0.5 mg/kg per day for one week; 0.25 mg/kg per day for one week).\nHIV co-infected patients not previously on treatment were initiated on fixeddose combination (FDC) antiretroviral treatment six weeks after initiation of TB treatment (FDC: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg, Emtricitabine 200 mg and Efavirenz 600 mg).\nPatients were randomly assigned to the intervention group with the use of a web-based randomisation system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine (dose 1.0 mg per day) for a total of six weeks, whereas the control group received a placebo for the same period (Fig. 1).\nPatients subsequently underwent serial echocardiographic examinations on an out-patient basis and adherence checks, including pill counts, were done at follow-up visits.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction and this diagnosis was made echocardiographically at four months post initial presentation.\nUpon completion of the follow-up period of all patients, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nTwo groups of patients were included: (1) definite TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured that no features of constriction were present at the time of enrolment in the study.\nFollow-up echocardiograms were performed four months after the initiation of therapy.\nThe echocardiograms were performed and co-reviewed by two experienced echocardiographers (who had both attended a dedicated workshop at a tertiary-level academic hospital aimed at the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP).\nA GE Vivid E6\u00ae ultrasound machine was used to perform a systematic examination according to the basic minimum standards as stipulated by the British Society of Echocardiography.\nNumerous other echocardiographic parameters were assessed, including the presence of a septal shudder, respiratophasic septal shift, left atrial enlargement and echocardiographic features of pericardial thickening (Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an additional three passed away during the follow-up period.\nIn-patient deaths were due to neutropenic sepsis, cerebrovascular incident and nosocomial pneumonia, respectively.\nIn all out-patient deaths, the cause was undetermined.\nFive patients were lost to follow up and one patient was removed from the study due to presumed drug side effects.\nA total of 21 patients completed the follow-up period (Fig. 5).\nThe study population had a female preponderance (66% females) and the mean age of the studied patients was 31 years.\nDisseminated pericardial tuberculosis was found to be a disease exclusive to the immune-compromised in this cohort; all 21 patients were HIV positive.\nThe median CD4+ count was 162 and 346 cells/mm3 in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively.\nOf the 21 eligible participants, 12 had been assigned to the treatment group and the remaining nine were in the placebo group.\nThe diagnosis of definite pericardial tuberculosis was made in 23.8% of the patients, while the remaining 76.2% were diagnosed on the basis of suggestive clinical and biochemical features (see inclusion criteria).\nOf the studied patients, 47.6% underwent pericardiocentesis, whereas the remaining 52.4% could not undergo safe pericardiocentesis.\nThe average volume of fluid drained via single pericardial aspiration was 622 ml.\nThe macroscopic appearance of the fluid varied from serosanguineous to haemorrhagic, reflecting the different pathological stages of development.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis was proven on pericardial aspirates in 50% of cases, either by positive culture (30%) or by direct PCR technique (Gene Xpert) (20%) (Table 2).\nPericardial constriction is the natural sequela of approximately 17 to 40% of TB pericardial infections.\nIn our cohort, the incidence of pericardial constriction (demonstrated by echocardiography) four months after the initial diagnosis was 23.8%.\nOf the five patients who developed pericardial constriction, two were in the control group and the remaining three were in the group treated with colchicine.\nOf those who did not develop pericardial constriction, nine were in the colchicine group and seven were in the placebo group.\nThe data from Table 3 yields a p-value of 0.88.\nThe relative risk for developing constriction in the colchicine group compared to the intervention group was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nThere was therefore no statistically demonstrable correlation between the use of colchicine and pericardial constriction in this study cohort.\nThe side effects among the patients using colchicine were usually minor; 56% of the initial 19 patients who were in the colchicine group reported self-limiting diarrhoea during their hospital stay.\nSerious side effects were observed in one patient who developed hepatitis during his course of treatment.\nThe patient was removed from the study and daily liver function testing showed a rapid recovery.\nAlthough the study was neither empowered nor designed to evaluate the effect of pericardiocentesis on the subsequent development of pericardial constriction, a very apparent and interesting finding was observed.\nWe found that, with the exception of one patient, all those who developed pericardial constriction were in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis.\nConversely, in the group that underwent pericardiocentesis, only one participant developed pericardial constriction.\nPericardiocentesis therefore seemed to be very effective in the prevention of pericardial constriction and in this cohort only one patient (10%) who underwent pericardiocentesis developed constriction.\nThese findings are observational and disregard the initial group allocations.\nDiscussion\nThe proverbial \u2018eureka moment\u2019 in the management of TB pericarditis seems to be elusive.\nNumerous interventions have been postulated and investigated in an attempt to prevent the devastating post-inflammatory changes in the pericardium following TB pericarditis.\nIn this pilot study, the merit of adding colchicine to the current management guidelines was investigated in a systematic manner.\nAs all the participants of this study were HIV positive, the findings can only be applied to this subgroup of patients with TB pericarditis.\nThere was a notable difference in the median CD4+ lymphocyte count between the treatment and placebo groups, but when assessed as an independent variable, no correlation could be demonstrated between degree of immunocompetency, as measured by CD4+ count, and the risk for development of constriction.\nThis pilot study could not demonstrate any benefit derived from the addition of colchicine to the routine management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe power of this pilot trial was insufficient to detect small differences in outcome; however, it appears that colchicine use has no correlation with the prevention or formation of post-TB CP.\nThis pilot trial could not assess the beneficial effects of colchicine in the HIV-negative patient with TB pericarditis.\nAfter considering the findings of this pilot research, the costs of the drug, the polypharmacy these patients are exposed to, drug\u2013drug interactions and side effects (albeit mild), this study would advise against the use of colchicine in the management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe implementation of a pericardiocentesis until dryness (with or without extended drainage) was up to this point never studied in a controlled or comparative manner.\nResearch conducted by Reuter et al. in 2007 found the first evidence to suggest the benefit of a pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage.\nIn their research, 162 patients with TB pericarditis underwent pericardiocentesis, and over a followup period of six years, only two patients (1.23%) developed fibrous pericardial constriction.\nThe research concluded that echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis with extended drainage is a safe and effective management option, and when combined with short-course anti-tuberculous therapy, it almost completely prevents the development of CP.\nA few leading centres are employing a routine \u2018pericardiocentesis until dryness\u2019 approach based on this literature, whereas most do not.\nThe interesting observation made in our pilot study was that the findings made by Reuters et al. in 2007 were reproducible on a much smaller scale.\nPericardial constriction, although having a low incidence, was almost exclusively seen in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis (observational \u2013 disregard original group allocation).\nAs suggested by some expert opinion and as supported by the data published by Reuters et al. and observational findings of our pilot trial, the practice of routine pericardiocentesis until dryness in the absence of contraindications appears to be the preferred management option and this might well be the long-awaited \u2018eureka moment\u2019, in an attempt to halt the development of pericardial constriction.\nLinitations of the study\nThe diagnosis of pericardial constriction was made with echocardiography, whereas the gold standard for diagnosing CP is invasive haemodynamic studies.\nWork done by Oh et al. and Boonyaratevej et al. demonstrated that one of the most characteristic findings of CP, a respiratory variation in early transmittal inflow velocity, is neither perfect in its sensitivity nor specificity for the diagnosis.\nIn patients with markedly elevated left atrial pressures, the respiratory variation in the inflow velocities may be less than 25%.\nFurthermore, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe right ventricular dysfunction, the variation may be elevated in the absence of CP.\nThis research emphasises the importance of using a variety of recognised echocardiographic diagnostic tools to confirm a non-invasive diagnosis of CP.\nThe duration of follow up was only four months.\nSome comparative research had follow-up periods of up to six years.\nMost patients who develop CP, do so in a period of three to four months.\nThere may however be patients who will only develop constriction after four months.\nResearch to address this aspect may be valuable.\nCorticosteroids were used as part of the standard therapy in all patients.\nHowever, subsequent to the initiation of the research, the IMPI trial brought to light their findings that corticosteroids should not be used in TB pericarditis in HIV-infected patients.\nThe South African National TB guidelines published in 2014 still advised the use of corticosteroids in all patients and the findings of the IMPI trial had not yet been incorporated into current South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines.\nConclusion\nBased on current research, the use of colchicine in addition to standard antituberculous therapy cannot be advised in the context of TB pericarditis in the HIV-positive population.\nThe jury is still out on which adjuvant strategies may prove to be beneficial in the prevention of CP, especially in the HIV-coinfected subgroup.\nBased on observations from this research and some other studies, routine pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage may prove to be the long-awaited solution to the common dilemma of post-TB CP.\nFlow diagram illustrating study methodology.\nA.

granulomatous scar-forming fibrocalcific constrictive pericarditis so commonly associated with this disease.\nNumerous therapies have previously been investigated as adjuvant strategies in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nColchicine is well described in the treatment of various aetiologies of pericarditis.\nThe aim of this research was to investigate the merit for the use of colchicine in the management of tuberculous pericarditis, specifically to prevent constrictive pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, double-blinded, randomised, control cohort study and was conducted at a secondary level hospital in the Northern Cape of South Africa between August 2013 and December 2015.\nPatients with a probable or definite diagnosis of TB pericarditis were included (n = 33).\nStudy participants with pericardial effusions amenable to pericardiocentesis underwent aspiration until dryness.\nAll patients were treated with standard TB treatment and corticosteroids in accordance with the South African Tuberculosis Treatment Guidelines.\nPatients were randomised to an intervention and control group using a webbased computer system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine 1.0 mg per day for six weeks and the control group received a placebo for the same period.\nPatients were followed up with serial echocardiography for 16 weeks.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction.\nUpon completion of the research period, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nResults\nTB pericarditis was found exclusively in HIV-positive individuals.\nThe incidence of pericardial constriction in our cohort was 23.8%.\nNo demonstrable benefit with the use of colchicine was found in terms of prevention of pericardial constriction (p = 0.88, relative risk 1.07, 95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nInterestingly, pericardiocentesis appeared to decrease the incidence of pericardial constriction.\nConclusion\nBased on this research, the use of colchicine in TB pericarditis cannot be advised.\nAdjuvant therapy in the prevention of pericardial constriction is still being investigated and routine pericardiocentesis may prove to be beneficial in this regard.\nIntroduction\nSouth Africa, a land of stark contrasts, contains a diverse natural beauty that can easily be compared with some of the world\u2019s most majestic outdoor scenes.\nOne of the new seven wonders of the natural world, Table Mountain, parades its splendour to the capital of South Africa, Cape Town.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is also considered by many to be one of the tuberculosis (TB) capitals of the world.\nThe incidence of TB in South Africa is estimated to have increased by over 400% in the past 15 years.\nThis is confounded by a staggering co-infection rate of approximately 73% with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nOne of the most dreaded complications of TB pericarditis is pericardial scar formation.\nDue to scarring, the pericardium becomes calcified and contracts over the cardiac chambers, thereby encasing the heart in a fibrocalcific skin that impedes diastolic filling.\nConstrictive pericarditis (CP) is the natural consequence of about 17 to 40% of cases of TB pericardial infection.\nThe definitive treatment of CP is surgical removal of the pericardium, a procedure with a significant peri-operative mortality rate of approximately 15%.\nSouth Africa is on the forefront of research on TB heart disease and has recently published the large, multi-centre IMPI trial.\nOne of the goals of the IMPI trial was to assess the impact of corticosteroids in the management of TB pericarditis.\nThe major findings of the study included (1) corticosteroids had no impact on mortality rates in patients with TB pericarditis, (2) corticosteroids decreased the incidence of pericardial constriction by 46%, and (3) HIV-positive patients who received corticosteroids had a significantly increased risk of developing HIV-associated malignancies.\nIn established TB, early and effective treatment with shortcourse anti-TB therapy is the mainstay of management.\nVarious strategies have been investigated as adjuncts to anti-TB drugs in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nThe ongoing discussions and numerous investigations into a wide array of agents as possible \u2018magic bullets\u2019 in the prevention of pericardial constriction (post-TB infection) illustrates both the interest in the field, and also the lack of a satisfying solution to this problem.\nThe following strategies have previously been evaluated: Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis,6 open surgical drainage (pericardial window), thalidomide, instilling intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapies, and a wide array of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\nNot one of these therapies has, to date, been internationally recognised as an acceptable standard of therapy, and the choice of adjuvant treatment varies significantly among experts in the field.\nColchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation.\nIt acts by binding to tubulin and is registered for the acute treatment of gout crystal arthropathies.\nThe plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described as treatment for arthritis in the Ebers Papyrus in 1500 BC.\nIn modern medicine, colchicine has however played a wider role in the treatment of pericarditis of various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in

granulomatous scar-forming fibrocalcific constrictive pericarditis so commonly associated with this disease.\nNumerous therapies have previously been investigated as adjuvant strategies in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nColchicine is well described in the treatment of various aetiologies of pericarditis.\nThe aim of this research was to investigate the merit for the use of colchicine in the management of tuberculous pericarditis, specifically to prevent constrictive pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, double-blinded, randomised, control cohort study and was conducted at a secondary level hospital in the Northern Cape of South Africa between August 2013 and December 2015.\nPatients with a probable or definite diagnosis of TB pericarditis were included (n = 33).\nStudy participants with pericardial effusions amenable to pericardiocentesis underwent aspiration until dryness.\nAll patients were treated with standard TB treatment and corticosteroids in accordance with the South African Tuberculosis Treatment Guidelines.\nPatients were randomised to an intervention and control group using a webbased computer system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine 1.0 mg per day for six weeks and the control group received a placebo for the same period.\nPatients were followed up with serial echocardiography for 16 weeks.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction.\nUpon completion of the research period, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nResults\nTB pericarditis was found exclusively in HIV-positive individuals.\nThe incidence of pericardial constriction in our cohort was 23.8%.\nNo demonstrable benefit with the use of colchicine was found in terms of prevention of pericardial constriction (p = 0.88, relative risk 1.07, 95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nInterestingly, pericardiocentesis appeared to decrease the incidence of pericardial constriction.\nConclusion\nBased on this research, the use of colchicine in TB pericarditis cannot be advised.\nAdjuvant therapy in the prevention of pericardial constriction is still being investigated and routine pericardiocentesis may prove to be beneficial in this regard.\nIntroduction\nSouth Africa, a land of stark contrasts, contains a diverse natural beauty that can easily be compared with some of the world\u2019s most majestic outdoor scenes.\nOne of the new seven wonders of the natural world, Table Mountain, parades its splendour to the capital of South Africa, Cape Town.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is also considered by many to be one of the tuberculosis (TB) capitals of the world.\nThe incidence of TB in South Africa is estimated to have increased by over 400% in the past 15 years.\nThis is confounded by a staggering co-infection rate of approximately 73% with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nOne of the most dreaded complications of TB pericarditis is pericardial scar formation.\nDue to scarring, the pericardium becomes calcified and contracts over the cardiac chambers, thereby encasing the heart in a fibrocalcific skin that impedes diastolic filling.\nConstrictive pericarditis (CP) is the natural consequence of about 17 to 40% of cases of TB pericardial infection.\nThe definitive treatment of CP is surgical removal of the pericardium, a procedure with a significant peri-operative mortality rate of approximately 15%.\nSouth Africa is on the forefront of research on TB heart disease and has recently published the large, multi-centre IMPI trial.\nOne of the goals of the IMPI trial was to assess the impact of corticosteroids in the management of TB pericarditis.\nThe major findings of the study included (1) corticosteroids had no impact on mortality rates in patients with TB pericarditis, (2) corticosteroids decreased the incidence of pericardial constriction by 46%, and (3) HIV-positive patients who received corticosteroids had a significantly increased risk of developing HIV-associated malignancies.\nIn established TB, early and effective treatment with shortcourse anti-TB therapy is the mainstay of management.\nVarious strategies have been investigated as adjuncts to anti-TB drugs in the prevention of pericardial constriction.\nThe ongoing discussions and numerous investigations into a wide array of agents as possible \u2018magic bullets\u2019 in the prevention of pericardial constriction (post-TB infection) illustrates both the interest in the field, and also the lack of a satisfying solution to this problem.\nThe following strategies have previously been evaluated: Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, corticosteroids, pericardiocentesis,6 open surgical drainage (pericardial window), thalidomide, instilling intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapies, and a wide array of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.\nNot one of these therapies has, to date, been internationally recognised as an acceptable standard of therapy, and the choice of adjuvant treatment varies significantly among experts in the field.\nColchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation.\nIt acts by binding to tubulin and is registered for the acute treatment of gout crystal arthropathies.\nThe plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described as treatment for arthritis in the Ebers Papyrus in 1500 BC.\nIn modern medicine, colchicine has however played a wider role in the treatment of pericarditis of various aetiologies, both acute and chronic.\nThis has been investigated in a prospective, randomised trial named COPE (Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis),13 and the major findings concluded that colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rates and symptom persistence due to pericarditis.\nTo date however, the use of colchicine has, to the best of our knowledge, never been systematically assessed in the context of pericardial TB.\nThe purpose of this research was to assess the merit for the use of colchicine in the context of TB pericarditis.\nMethods\nThis research was conducted in the Northern Cape province of South Africa at a secondary-level hospital in Kimberley between August 2013 and April 2015.\nThe research was approved by the ethics committee of the University of the Free State and the study was registered with the National Health Research Committee.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThis pilot study was designed as a prospective, doubleblind, randomised, control cohort.\nAll patients presenting to the Kimberley Hospital complex (KHC) with pericardial effusions were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nIn the absence of contra-indications, patients underwent therapeutic pericardiocentesis if the procedure was deemed safe and possible.\nStandard therapy was initiated in accordance with the South African National Tuberculosis Management Guidelines:14 weight-adjusted anti-TB drugs (Rifafourf\u00ae) and oral corticosteroids.\n(prednisone: 1.5 mg/kg per day for four weeks; 1.0 mg/kg per day for two weeks; 0.5 mg/kg per day for one week; 0.25 mg/kg per day for one week).\nHIV co-infected patients not previously on treatment were initiated on fixeddose combination (FDC) antiretroviral treatment six weeks after initiation of TB treatment (FDC: Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 300 mg, Emtricitabine 200 mg and Efavirenz 600 mg).\nPatients were randomly assigned to the intervention group with the use of a web-based randomisation system that ensured assignment concealment.\nThe intervention group received colchicine (dose 1.0 mg per day) for a total of six weeks, whereas the control group received a placebo for the same period (Fig. 1).\nPatients subsequently underwent serial echocardiographic examinations on an out-patient basis and adherence checks, including pill counts, were done at follow-up visits.\nThe primary outcome assessed was the development of pericardial constriction and this diagnosis was made echocardiographically at four months post initial presentation.\nUpon completion of the follow-up period of all patients, the blinding was unveiled and data were presented for statistical analysis.\nTwo groups of patients were included: (1) definite TB pericarditis: the presence of TB bacilli was observed on microscopic examination of pericardial fluid; cultures of pericardial fluid were positive for Rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB); pericardial fluid was positive for MTB on direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Gene Xpert); and (2) probable TB pericarditis: proof of TB was found elsewhere (positive cultures for MTB on sputum or cerebrospinal fluid); pericardial fluid with adenine deaminase (ADA) level > 40 U/l; a total diagnostic index score > 6 on using the Tygerberg clinical prediction score (Table 1).\nThe exclusion criteria were: patients with renal or hepatic impairment (creatinine clearance rate > 85 ml/min or transaminases > 1.5 upper limit of normal); and pregnant patients or patients intending to become pregnant within four months.\nThe gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CP is the demonstration of increased interventricular interdependence during cardiac catheterisation.\nDoppler echocardiography and other novel echocardiographic techniques have provided us with reliable non-invasive alternatives to the diagnosis of CP.\nIn this study, the diagnosis of CP was made by means of echocardiography by adhering to the principles in the article by Dal-Bianco et al. on the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP.\nInitial echocardiographic assessment ensured that no features of constriction were present at the time of enrolment in the study.\nFollow-up echocardiograms were performed four months after the initiation of therapy.\nThe echocardiograms were performed and co-reviewed by two experienced echocardiographers (who had both attended a dedicated workshop at a tertiary-level academic hospital aimed at the echocardiographic diagnosis of CP).\nA GE Vivid E6\u00ae ultrasound machine was used to perform a systematic examination according to the basic minimum standards as stipulated by the British Society of Echocardiography.\nNumerous other echocardiographic parameters were assessed, including the presence of a septal shudder, respiratophasic septal shift, left atrial enlargement and echocardiographic features of pericardial thickening (Figs 2\u20134).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed by the Department of Biostatistics of the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.\nThe SAS Version 8.3 was used.\nGroups were compared regarding outcomes using frequency tables with appropriate hypothesis testing (chi-squared of Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 95% confidence intervals for differences in percentages.\nThe standard deviation value p < 0.05 was considered significant.\nResults\nThirty-three patients met the initial inclusion criteria.\nThree patients passed away while in hospital and an additional three passed away during the follow-up period.\nIn-patient deaths were due to neutropenic sepsis, cerebrovascular incident and nosocomial pneumonia, respectively.\nIn all out-patient deaths, the cause was undetermined.\nFive patients were lost to follow up and one patient was removed from the study due to presumed drug side effects.\nA total of 21 patients completed the follow-up period (Fig. 5).\nThe study population had a female preponderance (66% females) and the mean age of the studied patients was 31 years.\nDisseminated pericardial tuberculosis was found to be a disease exclusive to the immune-compromised in this cohort; all 21 patients were HIV positive.\nThe median CD4+ count was 162 and 346 cells/mm3 in the colchicine and placebo groups, respectively.\nOf the 21 eligible participants, 12 had been assigned to the treatment group and the remaining nine were in the placebo group.\nThe diagnosis of definite pericardial tuberculosis was made in 23.8% of the patients, while the remaining 76.2% were diagnosed on the basis of suggestive clinical and biochemical features (see inclusion criteria).\nOf the studied patients, 47.6% underwent pericardiocentesis, whereas the remaining 52.4% could not undergo safe pericardiocentesis.\nThe average volume of fluid drained via single pericardial aspiration was 622 ml.\nThe macroscopic appearance of the fluid varied from serosanguineous to haemorrhagic, reflecting the different pathological stages of development.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis was proven on pericardial aspirates in 50% of cases, either by positive culture (30%) or by direct PCR technique (Gene Xpert) (20%) (Table 2).\nPericardial constriction is the natural sequela of approximately 17 to 40% of TB pericardial infections.\nIn our cohort, the incidence of pericardial constriction (demonstrated by echocardiography) four months after the initial diagnosis was 23.8%.\nOf the five patients who developed pericardial constriction, two were in the control group and the remaining three were in the group treated with colchicine.\nOf those who did not develop pericardial constriction, nine were in the colchicine group and seven were in the placebo group.\nThe data from Table 3 yields a p-value of 0.88.\nThe relative risk for developing constriction in the colchicine group compared to the intervention group was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.46\u20132.46).\nThere was therefore no statistically demonstrable correlation between the use of colchicine and pericardial constriction in this study cohort.\nThe side effects among the patients using colchicine were usually minor; 56% of the initial 19 patients who were in the colchicine group reported self-limiting diarrhoea during their hospital stay.\nSerious side effects were observed in one patient who developed hepatitis during his course of treatment.\nThe patient was removed from the study and daily liver function testing showed a rapid recovery.\nAlthough the study was neither empowered nor designed to evaluate the effect of pericardiocentesis on the subsequent development of pericardial constriction, a very apparent and interesting finding was observed.\nWe found that, with the exception of one patient, all those who developed pericardial constriction were in the group that did not undergo pericardiocentesis.\nConversely, in the group that underwent pericardiocentesis, only one participant developed pericardial constriction.\nPericardiocentesis therefore seemed to be very effective in the prevention of pericardial constriction and in this cohort only one patient (10%) who underwent pericardiocentesis developed constriction.\nThese findings are observational and disregard the initial group allocations.\nDiscussion\nThe proverbial \u2018eureka moment\u2019 in the management of TB pericarditis seems to be elusive.\nNumerous interventions have been postulated and investigated in an attempt to prevent the devastating post-inflammatory changes in the pericardium following TB pericarditis.\nIn this pilot study, the merit of adding colchicine to the current management guidelines was investigated in a systematic manner.\nAs all the participants of this study were HIV positive, the findings can only be applied to this subgroup of patients with TB pericarditis.\nThere was a notable difference in the median CD4+ lymphocyte count between the treatment and placebo groups, but when assessed as an independent variable, no correlation could be demonstrated between degree of immunocompetency, as measured by CD4+ count, and the risk for development of constriction.\nThis pilot study could not demonstrate any benefit derived from the addition of colchicine to the routine management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe power of this pilot trial was insufficient to detect small differences in outcome; however, it appears that colchicine use has no correlation with the prevention or formation of post-TB CP.\nThis pilot trial could not assess the beneficial effects of colchicine in the HIV-negative patient with TB pericarditis.\nAfter considering the findings of this pilot research, the costs of the drug, the polypharmacy these patients are exposed to, drug\u2013drug interactions and side effects (albeit mild), this study would advise against the use of colchicine in the management of HIV-positive patients with TB pericarditis.\nThe implementation of a pericardiocentesis until dryness (with or without extended drainage) was up to this point never studied in a controlled or comparative manner.\nResearch conducted by Reuter et al. in 2007 found the first evidence to suggest the benefit of a pericardiocentesis until dryness with extended drainage.\nIn their research, 162

log-rank, P=0.005] and OS (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028).\nWorse neutropenia (grade 3/4) was found in the ECdd-P than the PCdd arm (47.9% vs. 21.4%, P=0.001).\nConclusions\nPCdd was superior to ECdd-P as an adjuvant chemotherapy for early TNBC with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS.\nPCdd also yielded lower hematological toxicity.\nThus, PCdd might be a preferred regimen for early TNBC patients with a high recurrence risk.\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2).\nTNBCs, which account for approximately 12%\u221220% of all invasive breast cancers, are resistant to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy; their aggressive behavior and poor prognosis make them one of the most challenging cancers to treat.\nPostoperative adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, which is an important part of comprehensive treatment, can reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis.\nAt present, since the use of polygenic prognostic detection in domestic hospitals is low, the decision of adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer patients is relatively conservative.\nThe clinical application of an anthracycline sequential taxane regimen and aromatase inhibitors has also reached an expert consensus.\nSystemic chemotherapy is generally recommended by guidelines and is, thus, currently considered as a mainstay of TNBC management.\nHowever, the proposed chemotherapy regimens remain controversial.\nIn routine clinical practice, anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens are the most commonly used systemic cytotoxic regimens for TNBC patients.\nAdding platinum to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens not only substantially increases the pathological complete response (pCR) rate but may also improve the event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients according to previous trials.\nPlatinum-based neoadjuvant\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0may be recommended as an option in\u00a0TNBC\u00a0patients with the cost of higher hematological toxicity incidence.\nHowever, there is limited direct evidence regarding an appropriate platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy.\nFurthermore, determination of the optimal regimen balancing well-tolerated adverse toxicity with high efficacy is difficult.\nUnderlying genetic conditions appear to play an important role in TNBC.\nBRCA1-positive tumors show distinct clinic pathological characteristics.\nSeventy percent of all BRCA1-positive breast cancers and up to 23% of BRCA2 carriers have a TNBC phenotype.\nTNBC tumors with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation are associated with a better response to DNA-damaging systemic regimens such as the platinum agents.\nDose-dense chemotherapy (i.e., a chemotherapy regimen in which each cycle has a shortened treatment interval) is associated with significant improvements in survival and has been considered for use in the adjuvant setting for TNBC.\nWith granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, dose-dense chemotherapy regimens at the optimal dose have been permitted at two-week intervals rather than the conventional three-week cycle in early breast cancer regimens.\nData supporting platinum-based adjuvant regimens for TNBC are scarce and are based mostly on retrospective research.\nGiven the lack of well-established prospective or randomized studies, we conducted this study to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PCdd) with those of the commonly used dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (ECdd-P) as adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in Chinese TNBC patients with high recurrence risk.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThis was a randomized, open-label, single-center study conducted in Chinese females with TNBC at high recurrence risk.\nThe study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital (No. CH-BC-012).\nAll interventions were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, guidelines of the International Conference for Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice.\nThe study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT01378533).\nParticipants\nAll participating patients provided written informed consent.\nFemale patients aged 18\u221265 years who had undergone primary breast surgery for confirmed ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible.\nER, PR and HER2 status were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on patients\u2019 tumor sections.\nThe IHC cutoff for ER-negative and PR-negative status was 1% or less positive tumor cells with nuclear staining.\nHER2-negative status was determined by IHC by giving a score of 0 or 1 or by the absence ofHER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 and HER2 copies <4.0) upon fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\nER, PR and HER2 analyses were performed centrally in a single laboratory of National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\nPatients were selected with positive axillary lymph or with other high-risk factors for recurrence (e.g., age <35 years, grade III disease, and intravascular cancer embolus).\nFurther details regarding this study protocol are available in the Supplementary Table S1.\nRandomization and masking\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either the PCdd or the ECdd-P regimen.\nSimple randomization was conducted with no stratification factors and was carried out by using\u00a0random allocation sequence.\nThe patients, medical staff, and investigators were aware of treatment allocation and assessing outcomes.\nProcedures\nPatients in both study arms received treatment in two-week cycles.\nPatients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles.\nPatients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles.\nProphylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg was administered during each cycle according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines in the dose-dense setting.\nToxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nSafety was monitored with adverse events (AEs) reports, physical examinations, regular laboratory tests and electrocardiogram assessments at the end of each cycle until the 30th day of the last follow-up cycle.\nOutcomes\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, which was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (in the absence of other primary malignancies).\nSecondary objectives included OS and safety.\nOS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.\nWe analyzed the DFS and OS in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment (intention-to-treat population, ITT).\nIn the safety analysis, we evaluated the numbers and proportions of patients in each treatment arm who had any AEs, delay of chemotherapy, and dose reduction.\nAEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0).\nIn addition, we conducted exploratory subgroup analyses according to age (\u226440 vs. >40 years), Ki-67 index (\u226430 vs. >30), tumor size (<2 cm vs. \u22652 cm), nodal status (negative vs. positive), and surgery-chemotherapy interval (<30 dvs. \u226530 d) to investigate whether the treatment effect varied by subgroup.\nSample size computation\nThe sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate.\nAssuming an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 as a primary outcome in PCdd regimen (results of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion achieving 3-year DFS in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 participants (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power with an alpha level at 0.05, with a 5% dropout rate in each control/treatment arm.\nSince the censoring proportion during the course of the study might be higher than expected; therefore, the sample size was increased to 143 patients to ensure the target number of events would be reached in a reasonable time frame.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA).\nData were presented as numbers (%) or as the mean standard deviation.\nFrequency tables were analyzed by using the\u00a0\u03c72 test.\nThe survival analysis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method in the ITT population.\nThe hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model.\nPatients not showing progression were censored at the study cutoff date.\nThe multivariable Cox model was used for subgroup analysis to explore the influence of clinical characteristics on the 3-year DFS.\nThe safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and underwent at least one post-baseline safety assessment.\nA P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom June 2011 to December 2015, 143 patients were randomly enrolled in the PCdd arm (n=70) or the ECdd-P arm (n=73).\nAfter excluding 11 patients [treatment discontinuation due to tumor progression (n=1), withdrawal after chemotherapy (n=3), and lost to follow-up (n=7)], 132 patients who completed the planned eight cycles of chemotherapy were included in the per-protocol analysis (Figure 1).\nThe data cutoff for the primary analysis was November 30th, 2018.\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between arms (Table 1).\nAll enrolled patients had an Eastern\u00a0Cooperative\u00a0Oncology\u00a0Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0\u22121, and 62.2% were postmenopausal.\nThe median age was 49 (range, 22\u221264) years.\nIn total, 111 patients (77.6%) were aged older than 40 years.\nMost patients had stage II or III disease (n=92, 64.3%), and 90.9% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma.\nMore than 42% had T2\u2212T4 tumors, and 53 patients (37.1%) were clinically node positive.\nMore than 75% of patients had a Ki-67 proliferation index >30%.\nSurvival outcomes\nAs of cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up was 57.3 (range, 1.2\u221298.6) months, with 58.1 months in the PCdd arm and 56.1 months in the ECdd-P arm.\nIn total, 98 patients (74.2%) were followed up over 4 years.\nDuring the study period, 23 relapse events were recorded, 5 in the PCdd arm and 18 in the ECdd-P arm.\nMost events (96.2%) were observed during the first 3 years after first diagnosis.\nIn the full analysis of ITT population, patients had significantly fewer DFS events in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm (5 vs. 18; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank, P=0.005).\nThe 3-year DFS was 93.9% (95% CI, 88.2%\u221299.6%) in the PCdd arm and 79.1% (95% CI, 69.7\u221288.5%) in the ECdd-P arm.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for DFS remained separated for the rest of the 3-year follow-up (Figure 2).\nData on OS were immature.\nEight patients died in the ECdd-P arm, whereas only one died in the PCdd arm; all deaths were cancer related.\nPreliminary data showed a potential trend on a higher 3-year OS rate in the PCdd arm (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028) (Figure 3).\nSubgroup analyses showed a consistent DFS benefit in the PCdd arm, with the difference reaching statistical significance in the following subgroups: age >40 years (HR=4.31; 95% CI, 1.42\u221213.11; P=0.010), Ki-67 index >30% (HR=3.80; 95% CI, 1.08\u221213.36; P=0.038), and clinically evaluated lymph nodes (HR=5.73; 95% CI, 1.28\u221225.65; P=0.022) ( Figure 4).\nAEs\nOverall, both regimens were well tolerated with manageable AEs.\nThere were more patients who experienced chemotherapy delay [25 (35.7%) vs. 23 (31.5%), P=0.361] and dose reduction [16 (22.9%) vs. 14 (19.2%), P=0.369] in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm, but the difference was not significant (Table 2).\nThe most frequent AEs were neutropenia, nausea and emesis.\nThe incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the ECdd-P arm than that in the PCdd arm [35 (47.9%) vs. 15 (21.4%), P=0.001], while the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 AEs was similar between the two arms.\nThere was also no significant difference in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy between the two arms (Table 3).\nNo death or life-threatening event was recorded during the study or within 30 days after the last cycle of treatment.\nDiscussion\nThis open-label, randomized study achieved its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant difference in the 3-year DFS rate in patients randomized to receive PCdd as adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk early TNBC vs. ECdd-P (93.9% vs. 79.1%; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank P=0.005).\nFurther, PCdd was better tolerated than ECdd-P, with fewer hematological toxicities (grade 3/4) (21.4% and 47.9%, respectively).\nCollectively, these results indicate that PCdd might be an appropriate regimen for TNBC.\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of theBRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, as indicated herein by the clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety.\nTo our knowledge, this is an innovative randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of a dose-dense carboplatin-based regimen in the adjuvant setting for TNBC with high recurrence risk.\nTNBC may be more sensitive to platinum-based regimens.\nCarboplatin increased the pCR rate from 41% to 54% in the CALGB40603 trial and from 36.9% to 53.2% in the GeparSixto trial.\nIn the GeparSixto study, the improved pCR rate significantly increased the 3-year DFS rate from 76.1% to 85.8% (HR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.33\u22120.96; P=0.024).\nHowever, in the CALGB40603 study, the 5-year distant recurrence-free interval was 76.3% with no significant difference.\nThe randomized phase III clinical trial EA 1131 (NCT02445391) has also been designed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with residual TNBC.\nThe BrighTNess study has also confirmed that carboplatin-containing regimen appears to have a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for patients with high-risk TNBC in the neoadjuvant setting.\nHowever, the clinical benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC has not been well-investigated.\nFor an adjuvant scenario, a retrospective, single-center study in a Swiss breast cancer center reported a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 90% in patients treated with carboplatin.\nIn the present study, the PCdd regimen achieved significantly better survival benefit (3-year DFS and OS rates) for TNBC patients in the adjuvant setting compared with historical data from standard chemotherapy regimens (60%\u221280% with taxane-based regimens, 65%\u221285% with anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy, and 83.7% with anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab).\nA dose-dense regimen has been hypothesized to minimize residual tumor burden compared to dose escalation and serve as a more effective method for high-risk breast cancer.\nIn the CALGB9741 trial, the 4-year DFS rate was 82% in the dose-dense group.\nA previous study from our institution also compared the epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (EC-P) or epirubicin plus paclitaxel (EP) dose-dense group and the EP regular group regarding postoperative adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer.\nThe dose-dense group had higher 3-year RFS rates (84.1% vs. 80.0%, P=0.501) and OS rates (95.6% vs. 90.0%, P=0.153).\nOur trial is a novel prospective study showing significant improvements in the 3-year DFS and OS rates by using a dose-dense anthracycline-free platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for TNBC regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThe 3-year DFS (93.9%) and OS (98.5%) rates in the PCdd arm were also superior to those of a dose-dense regimen reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).\nAlthough the survival data in our study are immature at present, a relatively long follow-up time will allow us to report a beneficial trend in OS.\nIn addition, these data are comparable to previous data on anthracycline- and taxane-based dose-dense regimens.\nBecause the TNBC phenotype is closely associated with hereditary breast cancer, the administration of platinum-based regimens has received a new impetus.\nHowever, in the Chinese population, BRCA1/2 mutations are prevalent in only 10.5% of TNBC patients younger than 50 years.\nThe benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC with BRCA1/2 mutation(s) is still controversial.\nThe GeparSixto trial showed that carboplatin is more effective in TNBC patients; however, a secondary analysis of the GeparSixto demonstrated that TNBC patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations would also benefit from the addition of carboplatin, which increased the DFS rate (85.3% in the carboplatin group and 73.5% in the non-carboplatin group; HR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29\u22120.96; P=0.04).\nThe BRCA1/2 mutation status plays an important role for tumor identification in TNBC patients with higher response rate of platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy.\nHowever, other studies have shown that the clinical use of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test may also have the potential to identify patients with TNBC that may respond to the treatment of DNA damage, in excess of those currently identified by gBRCA1/2 mutational screening.\nIt has been suggested that tumors carrying gBRCA mutations may be sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, including platinum.\nIn the present study, we found that for early TNBC patients, the addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel was superior to epirubicin plus paclitaxel with respect to the 3-year DFS among BRCA1/2 unselected patients.\nTo analyze the trends in adjuvant regimens for TNBC and to explore the factors influencing efficacy, we demonstrated that patients aged >40 years, with Ki-67 index >30%, and clinically evaluated lymph nodes were found to have a survival advantage from the PCdd regimen.\nFuture refinement of platinum-sensitive subgroups for targeting specific tumor biomarkers in TNBC is warranted ().\nWith respect to tolerance, previous trials showed a high incidence of AEs and an increasing discontinuation rate for dose-dense chemotherapy of TNBC.\nThe PCdd regimen, which yields fewer adverse toxicities, may be considered a better alternative for the high-risk group of patients in our study, particularly for older patients.\nThe toxicity profile in our study was as anticipated: gastrointestinal toxic effects were more common in the PCdd arm, while grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was more common in the ECdd-P arm.\nAll gastrointestinal toxic effects were manageable and self-limiting.\nThese findings indicate that the PCdd regimen can be recommended to reduce unnecessary toxicities.\nOur study has some limitations, including its small sample size and the potential investigator bias from a single-center institutional experience.\nFurther, we had limited statistical power to show a significant OS benefit.\nA longer follow-up time is necessary, and the median OS should be further evaluated.\nIn addition, given the financial and technical limitations during the study period, the BRCA mutation status was not analyzed to identify whether the gBRCA subgroup will benefit from the PCdd regimen.\nFurther prospective trials to evaluate other platinum-based regimens in the adjuvant setting for TNBC are warranted, particularly to define a sensitive population.\nAn ongoing phase III trial in National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCT03876886 at http://ClinicalTrials.gov) might provide further insight to evaluate the incorporation of platinum in the adjuvant setting, to detect HRD, and to identify specific TNBC patients who might benefit from carboplatin-based therapy.\nConclusions\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, with clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety data.\nFlow diagram of study design.

The trial includes two groups: ECdd-P and PCdd.\nEligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the PCdd group or the ECdd-P group. Randomization was conducted with no stratification factors. Eligible patients will be continually enrolled into the study until the total number of patients reached the planned sample size. The patients, medical staff and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. Sample size was determined based on a superiority test of 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level, with a 10% dropout rate (5% in each control/treatment arm). The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). Primary and secondary efficacy analyses include the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of all randomly assigned patients. The safety analysis population includes all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.\n\nEligibility | Inclusion criteria: 1) Patient must accept the primary breast surgery; 2) Patients with histologically confirmed ER (\u2212), PR (\u2212) and HER2 (\u2212),i.e., <1% positive tumor cells with nuclear staining in IHC and no HER2 overexpression; 3) Positive axillary lymph nodes; negative axillary lymph node with age <35 years or III grade or intravascular cancer embolus; 4) Age between 18 years to 65 years; 5) Able to give informed consent; 6) Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1; 7) Not pregnant, and on appropriate birth control if of child-bearing potential; 8) Adequate bone marrow reserve with ANC >1.5\u00d710 9/L and platelets >100\u00d710 9/L; 9) Adequate renal function with serum creatinine <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal; 10) Adequate hepatic reserve with serum bilirubin <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, AST/ALT <2\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase < 5\u00d7 the upper limit of normal. Serum bilirubin >2.0 is acceptable in the setting of known Gilbert\u2019s syndrome; and 11) No active major medical or psychosocial problems that could be complicated by study participation.\nExclusion criteria: 1) Received neo-adjuvant therapy; 2) cardiac dysfunction documented by an ejection fraction less than the lower limit of the facility normal by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan, or 45% by echocardiogram; 3) uncontrolled medical problems; 4) evidence of active acute or chronic infection; 5) pregnant or breast feeding; or 6) hepatic, renal or bone marrow dysfunction as detailed above.\n\nSample size calculation | The target sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of 0.13 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level. The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). The proportion of drop out in the control and treatment group was 0.1000 (each 0.05).\nRandomization | Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised under concealment, by the study lead investigator (Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), according to prespecified randomisation number lists to receive ECdd-P or PCdd.\nTreatment | Administration: Patients in both study groups received treatment in 14-day cycles. Patients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles. Patients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Prophylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 was given for each chemotherapy cycle.\n\nSafety assessments and dose modifications | Safety assessments included 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital sign taking and clinical laboratory evaluations every cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each treatment cycle until 28 follow-up d after the end of study visit. Toxicity was graded by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0). Febrile neutropenia was managed according to institutional treatment guidelines in China. Toxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nStudy drugs | Drug: epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin, G-CSF epirubicin 80 mg/m2 iv divide in 2 d cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 iv d 1 carboplatin AUC=3 iv d 2 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d78 cycles.\n\nConcomitant medications | 1. Antiemetics can be prescribed to patients who are vomiting due to administration of treatment drug(s);\n2. Patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy can be treated with neurotropic supplements such as duloxetine, vitamin B, etc.;\n3. Analgesics can be used for patients who have pain affecting quality of life;\n4. Patients with constipation, diarrhea, or other conditions can be treated using appropriate medication for their respective condition;\n5. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed.\n6. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nOutcome measures | Primary outcome measure:\nThe primary endpoint is 3-year DFS rate. DFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (without second primary malignancies), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\nSecondary outcome measures:\nSecondary endpoints include 3-year OS (defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause) and safety of the treatment. Toxicity was graded by using the NCI- CTCAE, version 3.0.\n\nSafety parameters | AEs, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests\nStatistical analysis | All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA). Data on clinical characteristics, chemotherapy, recurrence, and survival were analyzed. Data were presented as the number (%) or the mean standard deviation. Continuous variables were compared using the Student\u2019s t test, while categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact test.\nThe proportion of patients remaining event-free over time will be displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using a two-sided log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe safety population will include all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. For safety analysis, AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Analysis of AEs will be based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs are AEs not present prior to medical treatment, or are already present and worsen either in intensity or frequency following treatment. The incidence rate of TEAEs will be described according to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Meanwhile, serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to study discontinuation will be similarly summarized and tabulated. Laboratory tests will be analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis.\n\nFollow-up | All treated patients will be followed-up with once every 3 months to collect survival information for DFS and OS. Patients who discontinue treatment due to any causes will be followed-up with once every 3 months until disease recurrence or death. After disease recurrence, patient follow up can be conducted by phone or as general clinical visits until death.\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancer\nVariable | ECdd-P arm (N=73) [n (%)] | PCdd arm (N=70) [n (%)] | P\nECdd-P, dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; PCdd, dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin; IDC, invasive ductal carcinoma; ILC, invasive lobular carcinoma; MRM, modified radical mastectomy; BCS, breast conservative surgery; SLN, simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy; SCI, surgery chemotherapy interval.\nAge [mean (range)] (year) | 46 (26\u221264) | 49 (22\u221263) | 0.216\n\u3000\u226440 | 20 (27.4) | 12 (17.1) | 0.163\n\u3000>40 | 53 (72.6) | 58 (82.9) | \nMenopause at diagnosis |  |  | \n\u3000Post-menopause | 50 (68.5) | 39 (55.7) | 0.124\n\u3000Pre-menopause | 23 (31.5) | 31 (44.3) | \nPathology |  |  | 0.114\n\u3000IDC | 63 (86.3) | 67 (95.7) | \n\u3000ILC | 2 (2.7) | 0 (0) | \n\u3000Other type | 8 (11.0) | 3 (4.3) | \nTumor size (cm) |  |  | 0.179\n\u3000<2 | 27 (37.0) | 34 (48.6) | \n\u3000\u22652 | 46 (63.0) | 36 (51.4) | \nLymph node metastasis |  |  | 0.604\n\u3000Yes | 29 (39.7) | 24 (34.3) | \n\u3000No | 44 (60.3) | 46 (65.7) | \nIntravascular cancer embolus |  |  | 0.167\n\u3000Yes | 16 (21.9) | 10 (14.3) | \n\u3000No | 57 (78.1) | 60 (85.7) | \nNuclear grade |  |  | 0.999\n\u3000Grade 1, 2 | 23 (31.5) | 22 (31.4) | \n\u3000Grade 3 | 50 (68.5) | 48 (68.6) | \nKi-67 |  |  | 0.108\n\u3000\u226430 | 12 (16.4) | 20 (28.6) | \n\u3000>30 | 61 (83.6) | 50 (71.4) | \nTNM stage |  |  | 0.104\n\u3000I | 24 (32.9) | 27 (38.6) | \n\u3000II/III | 49 (67.1) | 43 (61.4) | \nType of surgery |  |  | 0.309\n\u3000MRM | 57 (78.1) | 54 (77.1) | \n\u3000BCS | 13 (17.8) | 9 (12.9) | \n\u3000SLN | 3 (4.1) | 7 (10.0) | \nRadiotherapy |  |  | 0.141\n\u3000Yes | 42 (57.5) | 33 (47.1) | \n\u3000No | 31 (42.5) | 37 (52.9) | \nSCI (d) |  |  | 0.609\n\u3000<30 | 47 (64.4) | 42 (60.0) | \n\u3000\u226530 | 26 (35.6) | 28 (40.0) | \n\n\nTreatment exposure in TNBC patients treated with ECdd-P/PCdd chemotherapy\nVariables | n (%) | P\nECdd-P Arm (N=73) | PCdd Arm (N=70)\nTNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; ECdd-P, dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; PCdd, dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin.\nFollow-up time [Median (range)] (month) | 56.1 (2.8\u221298.6) | 58.1 (1.2\u221276.6) | 0.320\nNumber of chemotherapy cycles |  |  | \n\u3000Total | 573 | 552 | \n\u3000Median | 8 (3\u22128) | 8 (2\u22128) | 0.783\nDelay of chemotherapy |  |  | 0.361\n\u3000Yes | 23 (31.5) | 25 (35.7) | \n\u3000No | 50 (68.5) | 45 (64.3) | \nDose reduction |  |  | 0.369\n\u3000Yes | 14 (19.2) | 16 (22.9) | \n\u3000No | 59 (80.8) | 54 (77.1) | \n\n\nCommon adverse events in TNBC patients treated with ECdd-P/PCdd chemotherapy\nAdverse events | n (%) | P*\nECdd-P arm (n=73) | PCdd arm (n=70)\nA patient could have experienced more than one specific toxicity.

followed by paclitaxel (ECdd-P) as an adjuvant chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\nMethods\nWe included Chinese patients with high recurrence risk TNBC who underwent primary breast cancer surgery.\nThey were randomly assigned to receive PCdd [paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 and carboplatin, the area under the curve, (AUC)=3 on d 2] or ECdd-P (epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles) every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.\nThe primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS); the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety.\nResults\nThe intent-to-treat population included 143 patients (70 in the PCdd arm and 73 in the ECdd-P arm).\nCompared with the ECdd-P arm, the PCdd arm had significantly higher 3-year DFS [93.9% vs. 79.1%; hazard ratio (HR)=0.310; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank, P=0.005] and OS (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028).\nWorse neutropenia (grade 3/4) was found in the ECdd-P than the PCdd arm (47.9% vs. 21.4%, P=0.001).\nConclusions\nPCdd was superior to ECdd-P as an adjuvant chemotherapy for early TNBC with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS.\nPCdd also yielded lower hematological toxicity.\nThus, PCdd might be a preferred regimen for early TNBC patients with a high recurrence risk.\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2).\nTNBCs, which account for approximately 12%\u221220% of all invasive breast cancers, are resistant to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy; their aggressive behavior and poor prognosis make them one of the most challenging cancers to treat.\nPostoperative adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, which is an important part of comprehensive treatment, can reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis.\nAt present, since the use of polygenic prognostic detection in domestic hospitals is low, the decision of adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer patients is relatively conservative.\nThe clinical application of an anthracycline sequential taxane regimen and aromatase inhibitors has also reached an expert consensus.\nSystemic chemotherapy is generally recommended by guidelines and is, thus, currently considered as a mainstay of TNBC management.\nHowever, the proposed chemotherapy regimens remain controversial.\nIn routine clinical practice, anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens are the most commonly used systemic cytotoxic regimens for TNBC patients.\nAdding platinum to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens not only substantially increases the pathological complete response (pCR) rate but may also improve the event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients according to previous trials.\nPlatinum-based neoadjuvant\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0may be recommended as an option in\u00a0TNBC\u00a0patients with the cost of higher hematological toxicity incidence.\nHowever, there is limited direct evidence regarding an appropriate platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy.\nFurthermore, determination of the optimal regimen balancing well-tolerated adverse toxicity with high efficacy is difficult.\nUnderlying genetic conditions appear to play an important role in TNBC.\nBRCA1-positive tumors show distinct clinic pathological characteristics.\nSeventy percent of all BRCA1-positive breast cancers and up to 23% of BRCA2 carriers have a TNBC phenotype.\nTNBC tumors with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation are associated with a better response to DNA-damaging systemic regimens such as the platinum agents.\nDose-dense chemotherapy (i.e., a chemotherapy regimen in which each cycle has a shortened treatment interval) is associated with significant improvements in survival and has been considered for use in the adjuvant setting for TNBC.\nWith granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, dose-dense chemotherapy regimens at the optimal dose have been permitted at two-week intervals rather than the conventional three-week cycle in early breast cancer regimens.\nData supporting platinum-based adjuvant regimens for TNBC are scarce and are based mostly on retrospective research.\nGiven the lack of well-established prospective or randomized studies, we conducted this study to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PCdd) with those of the commonly used dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (ECdd-P) as adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in Chinese TNBC patients with high recurrence risk.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThis was a randomized, open-label, single-center study conducted in Chinese females with TNBC at high recurrence risk.\nThe study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital (No. CH-BC-012).\nAll interventions were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, guidelines of the International Conference for Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice.\nThe study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT01378533).\nParticipants\nAll participating patients provided written informed consent.\nFemale patients aged 18\u221265 years who had undergone primary breast surgery for confirmed ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible.\nER, PR and HER2 status were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on patients\u2019 tumor sections.\nThe IHC cutoff for ER-negative and PR-negative status was 1% or less positive tumor cells with nuclear staining.\nHER2-negative status was determined by IHC by giving a score of 0 or 1 or by the absence ofHER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 and HER2 copies <4.0) upon fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\nER, PR and HER2 analyses were performed centrally in a single laboratory of National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\nPatients were selected with positive axillary lymph or with other high-risk factors for recurrence (e.g., age <35 years, grade III disease, and intravascular cancer embolus).\nFurther details regarding this study protocol are available in the Supplementary Table S1.\nRandomization and masking\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either the PCdd or the ECdd-P regimen.\nSimple randomization was conducted with no stratification factors and was carried out by using\u00a0random allocation sequence.\nThe patients, medical staff, and investigators were aware of treatment allocation and assessing outcomes.\nProcedures\nPatients in both study arms received treatment in two-week cycles.\nPatients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles.\nPatients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles.\nProphylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg was administered during each cycle according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines in the dose-dense setting.\nToxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nSafety was monitored with adverse events (AEs) reports, physical examinations, regular laboratory tests and electrocardiogram assessments at the end of each cycle until the 30th day of the last follow-up cycle.\nOutcomes\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, which was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (in the absence of other primary malignancies).\nSecondary objectives included OS and safety.\nOS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.\nWe analyzed the DFS and OS in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment (intention-to-treat population, ITT).\nIn the safety analysis, we evaluated the numbers and proportions of patients in each treatment arm who had any AEs, delay of chemotherapy, and dose reduction.\nAEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0).\nIn addition, we conducted exploratory subgroup analyses according to age (\u226440 vs. >40 years), Ki-67 index (\u226430 vs. >30), tumor size (<2 cm vs. \u22652 cm), nodal status (negative vs. positive), and surgery-chemotherapy interval (<30 dvs. \u226530 d) to investigate whether the treatment effect varied by subgroup.\nSample size computation\nThe sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate.\nAssuming an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 as a primary outcome in PCdd regimen (results of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion achieving 3-year DFS in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 participants (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power with an alpha level at 0.05, with a 5% dropout rate in each control/treatment arm.\nSince the censoring proportion during the course of the study might be higher than expected; therefore, the sample size was increased to 143 patients to ensure the target number of events would be reached in a reasonable time frame.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA).\nData were presented as numbers (%) or as the mean standard deviation.\nFrequency tables were analyzed by using the\u00a0\u03c72 test.\nThe survival analysis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method in the ITT population.\nThe hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model.\nPatients not showing progression were censored at the study cutoff date.\nThe multivariable Cox model was used for subgroup analysis to explore the influence of clinical characteristics on the 3-year DFS.\nThe safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and underwent at least one post-baseline safety assessment.\nA P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom June 2011 to December 2015, 143 patients were randomly enrolled in the PCdd arm (n=70) or the ECdd-P arm (n=73).\nAfter excluding 11 patients [treatment discontinuation due to tumor progression (n=1), withdrawal after chemotherapy (n=3), and lost to follow-up (n=7)], 132 patients who completed the planned eight cycles of chemotherapy were included in the per-protocol analysis (Figure 1).\nThe data cutoff for the primary analysis was November 30th, 2018.\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between arms (Table 1).\nAll enrolled patients had an Eastern\u00a0Cooperative\u00a0Oncology\u00a0Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0\u22121, and 62.2% were postmenopausal.\nThe median age was 49 (range, 22\u221264) years.\nIn total, 111 patients (77.6%) were aged older than 40 years.\nMost patients had stage II or III disease (n=92, 64.3%), and 90.9% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma.\nMore than 42% had T2\u2212T4 tumors, and 53 patients (37.1%) were clinically node positive.\nMore than 75% of patients had a Ki-67 proliferation index >30%.\nSurvival outcomes\nAs of cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up was 57.3 (range, 1.2\u221298.6) months, with 58.1 months in the PCdd arm and 56.1 months in the ECdd-P arm.\nIn total, 98 patients (74.2%) were followed up over 4 years.\nDuring the study period, 23 relapse events were recorded, 5 in the PCdd arm and 18 in the ECdd-P arm.\nMost events (96.2%) were observed during the first 3 years after first diagnosis.\nIn the full analysis of ITT population, patients had significantly fewer DFS events in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm (5 vs. 18; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank, P=0.005).\nThe 3-year DFS was 93.9% (95% CI, 88.2%\u221299.6%) in the PCdd arm and 79.1% (95% CI, 69.7\u221288.5%) in the ECdd-P arm.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for DFS remained separated for the rest of the 3-year follow-up (Figure 2).\nData on OS were immature.\nEight patients died in the ECdd-P arm, whereas only one died in the PCdd arm; all deaths were cancer related.\nPreliminary data showed a potential trend on a higher 3-year OS rate in the PCdd arm (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028) (Figure 3).\nSubgroup analyses showed a consistent DFS benefit in the PCdd arm, with the difference reaching statistical significance in the following subgroups: age >40 years (HR=4.31; 95% CI, 1.42\u221213.11; P=0.010), Ki-67 index >30% (HR=3.80; 95% CI, 1.08\u221213.36; P=0.038), and clinically evaluated lymph nodes (HR=5.73; 95% CI, 1.28\u221225.65; P=0.022) ( Figure 4).\nAEs\nOverall, both regimens were well tolerated with manageable AEs.\nThere were more patients who experienced chemotherapy delay [25 (35.7%) vs. 23 (31.5%), P=0.361] and dose reduction [16 (22.9%) vs. 14 (19.2%), P=0.369] in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm, but the difference was not significant (Table 2).\nThe most frequent AEs were neutropenia, nausea and emesis.\nThe incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the ECdd-P arm than that in the PCdd arm [35 (47.9%) vs. 15 (21.4%), P=0.001], while the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 AEs was similar between the two arms.\nThere was also no significant difference in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy between the two arms (Table 3).\nNo death or life-threatening event was recorded during the study or within 30 days after the last cycle of treatment.\nDiscussion\nThis open-label, randomized study achieved its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant difference in the 3-year DFS rate in patients randomized to receive PCdd as adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk early TNBC vs. ECdd-P (93.9% vs. 79.1%; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank P=0.005).\nFurther, PCdd was better tolerated than ECdd-P, with fewer hematological toxicities (grade 3/4) (21.4% and 47.9%, respectively).\nCollectively, these results indicate that PCdd might be an appropriate regimen for TNBC.\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of theBRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, as indicated herein by the clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety.\nTo our knowledge, this is an innovative randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of a dose-dense carboplatin-based regimen in the adjuvant setting for TNBC with high recurrence risk.\nTNBC may be more sensitive to platinum-based regimens.\nCarboplatin increased the pCR rate from 41% to 54% in the CALGB40603 trial and from 36.9% to 53.2% in the GeparSixto trial.\nIn the GeparSixto study, the improved pCR rate significantly increased the 3-year DFS rate from 76.1% to 85.8% (HR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.33\u22120.96; P=0.024).\nHowever, in the CALGB40603 study, the 5-year distant recurrence-free interval was 76.3% with no significant difference.\nThe randomized phase III clinical trial EA 1131 (NCT02445391) has also been designed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with residual TNBC.\nThe BrighTNess study has also confirmed that carboplatin-containing regimen appears to have a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for patients with high-risk TNBC in the neoadjuvant setting.\nHowever, the clinical benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC has not been well-investigated.\nFor an adjuvant scenario, a retrospective, single-center study in a Swiss breast cancer center reported a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 90% in patients treated with carboplatin.\nIn the present study, the PCdd regimen achieved significantly better survival benefit (3-year DFS and OS rates) for TNBC patients in the adjuvant setting compared with historical data from standard chemotherapy regimens (60%\u221280% with taxane-based regimens, 65%\u221285% with anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy, and 83.7% with anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab).\nA dose-dense regimen has been hypothesized to minimize residual tumor burden compared to dose escalation and serve as a more effective method for high-risk breast cancer.\nIn the CALGB9741 trial, the 4-year DFS rate was 82% in the dose-dense group.\nA previous study from our institution also compared the epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (EC-P) or epirubicin plus paclitaxel (EP) dose-dense group and the EP regular group regarding postoperative adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer.\nThe dose-dense group had higher 3-year RFS rates (84.1% vs. 80.0%, P=0.501) and OS rates (95.6% vs. 90.0%, P=0.153).\nOur trial is a novel prospective study showing significant improvements in the 3-year DFS and OS rates by using a dose-dense anthracycline-free platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for TNBC regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThe 3-year DFS (93.9%) and OS (98.5%) rates in the PCdd arm were also superior to those of a dose-dense regimen reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).\nAlthough the survival data in our study are immature at present, a relatively long follow-up time will allow us to report a beneficial trend in OS.\nIn addition, these data are comparable to previous data on anthracycline- and taxane-based dose-dense regimens.\nBecause the TNBC phenotype is closely associated with hereditary breast cancer, the administration of platinum-based regimens has received a new impetus.\nHowever, in the Chinese population, BRCA1/2 mutations are prevalent in only 10.5% of TNBC patients younger than 50 years.\nThe benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC with BRCA1/2 mutation(s) is still controversial.\nThe GeparSixto trial showed that carboplatin is more effective in TNBC patients; however, a secondary analysis of the GeparSixto demonstrated that TNBC patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations would also benefit from the addition of carboplatin, which increased the DFS rate (85.3% in the carboplatin group and 73.5% in the non-carboplatin group; HR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29\u22120.96; P=0.04).\nThe BRCA1/2 mutation status plays an important role for tumor identification in TNBC patients with higher response rate of platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy.\nHowever, other studies have shown that the clinical use of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test may also have the potential to identify patients with TNBC that may respond to the treatment of DNA damage, in excess of those currently identified by gBRCA1/2 mutational screening.\nIt has been suggested that tumors carrying gBRCA mutations may be sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, including platinum.\nIn the present study, we found that for early TNBC patients, the addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel was superior to epirubicin plus paclitaxel with respect to the 3-year DFS among BRCA1/2 unselected patients.\nTo analyze the trends in adjuvant regimens for TNBC and to explore the factors influencing efficacy, we demonstrated that patients aged >40 years, with Ki-67 index >30%, and clinically evaluated lymph nodes were found to have a survival advantage from the PCdd regimen.\nFuture refinement of platinum-sensitive subgroups for targeting specific tumor biomarkers in TNBC is warranted ().\nWith respect to tolerance, previous trials showed a high incidence of AEs and an increasing discontinuation rate for dose-dense chemotherapy of TNBC.\nThe PCdd regimen, which yields fewer adverse toxicities, may be considered a better alternative for the high-risk group of patients in our study, particularly for older patients.\nThe toxicity profile in our study was as anticipated: gastrointestinal toxic effects were more common in the PCdd arm, while grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was more common in the ECdd-P arm.\nAll gastrointestinal toxic effects were manageable and self-limiting.\nThese findings indicate that the PCdd regimen can be recommended to reduce unnecessary toxicities.\nOur study has some limitations, including its small sample size and the potential investigator bias from a single-center institutional experience.\nFurther, we had limited statistical power to show a significant OS benefit.\nA longer follow-up time is necessary, and the median OS should be further evaluated.\nIn addition, given the financial and technical limitations during the study period, the BRCA mutation status was not analyzed to identify whether the gBRCA subgroup will benefit from the PCdd regimen.\nFurther prospective trials to evaluate other platinum-based regimens in the adjuvant setting for TNBC are warranted, particularly to define a sensitive population.\nAn ongoing phase III trial in National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCT03876886 at http://ClinicalTrials.gov) might provide further insight to evaluate the incorporation of platinum in the adjuvant setting, to detect HRD, and to identify specific TNBC patients who might benefit from carboplatin-based therapy.\nConclusions\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, with clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety data.\nFlow diagram of study design.

The trial includes two groups: ECdd-P and PCdd.\nEligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the PCdd group or the ECdd-P group. Randomization was conducted with no stratification factors. Eligible patients will be continually enrolled into the study until the total number of patients reached the planned sample size. The patients, medical staff and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. Sample size was determined based on a superiority test of 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level, with a 10% dropout rate (5% in each control/treatment arm). The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). Primary and secondary efficacy analyses include the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of all randomly assigned patients. The safety analysis population includes all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.\n\nEligibility | Inclusion criteria: 1) Patient must accept the primary breast surgery; 2) Patients with histologically confirmed ER (\u2212), PR (\u2212) and HER2 (\u2212),i.e., <1% positive tumor cells with nuclear staining in IHC and no HER2 overexpression; 3) Positive axillary lymph nodes; negative axillary lymph node with age <35 years or III grade or intravascular cancer embolus; 4) Age between 18 years to 65 years; 5) Able to give informed consent; 6) Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1; 7) Not pregnant, and on appropriate birth control if of child-bearing potential; 8) Adequate bone marrow reserve with ANC >1.5\u00d710 9/L and platelets >100\u00d710 9/L; 9) Adequate renal function with serum creatinine <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal; 10) Adequate hepatic reserve with serum bilirubin <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, AST/ALT <2\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase < 5\u00d7 the upper limit of normal. Serum bilirubin >2.0 is acceptable in the setting of known Gilbert\u2019s syndrome; and 11) No active major medical or psychosocial problems that could be complicated by study participation.\nExclusion criteria: 1) Received neo-adjuvant therapy; 2) cardiac dysfunction documented by an ejection fraction less than the lower limit of the facility normal by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan, or 45% by echocardiogram; 3) uncontrolled medical problems; 4) evidence of active acute or chronic infection; 5) pregnant or breast feeding; or 6) hepatic, renal or bone marrow dysfunction as detailed above.\n\nSample size calculation | The target sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of 0.13 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level. The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). The proportion of drop out in the control and treatment group was 0.1000 (each 0.05).\nRandomization | Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised under concealment, by the study lead investigator (Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), according to prespecified randomisation number lists to receive ECdd-P or PCdd.\nTreatment | Administration: Patients in both study groups received treatment in 14-day cycles. Patients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles. Patients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Prophylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 was given for each chemotherapy cycle.\n\nSafety assessments and dose modifications | Safety assessments included 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital sign taking and clinical laboratory evaluations every cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each treatment cycle until 28 follow-up d after the end of study visit. Toxicity was graded by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0). Febrile neutropenia was managed according to institutional treatment guidelines in China. Toxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nStudy drugs | Drug: epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin, G-CSF epirubicin 80 mg/m2 iv divide in 2 d cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 iv d 1 carboplatin AUC=3 iv d 2 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d78 cycles.\n\nConcomitant medications | 1. Antiemetics can be prescribed to patients who are vomiting due to administration of treatment drug(s);\n2. Patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy can be treated with neurotropic supplements such as duloxetine, vitamin B, etc.;\n3. Analgesics can be used for patients who have pain affecting quality of life;\n4. Patients with constipation, diarrhea, or other conditions can be treated using appropriate medication for their respective condition;\n5. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed.\n6. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nOutcome measures | Primary outcome measure:\nThe primary endpoint is 3-year DFS rate. DFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (without second primary malignancies), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\nSecondary outcome measures:\nSecondary endpoints include 3-year OS (defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause) and safety of the treatment. Toxicity was graded by using the NCI- CTCAE, version 3.0.\n\nSafety parameters | AEs, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests\nStatistical analysis | All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA). Data on clinical characteristics, chemotherapy, recurrence, and survival were analyzed. Data were presented as the number (%) or the mean standard deviation. Continuous variables were compared using the Student\u2019s t test, while categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact test.\nThe proportion of patients remaining event-free over time will be displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using a two-sided log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe safety population will include all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. For safety analysis, AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Analysis of AEs will be based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs are AEs not present prior to medical treatment, or are already present and worsen either in intensity or frequency following treatment. The incidence rate of TEAEs will be described according to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Meanwhile, serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to study discontinuation will be similarly summarized and tabulated. Laboratory tests will be analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis.\n\nFollow-up | All treated patients will be followed-up with once every 3 months to collect survival information for DFS and OS.

followed by paclitaxel (ECdd-P) as an adjuvant chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\nMethods\nWe included Chinese patients with high recurrence risk TNBC who underwent primary breast cancer surgery.\nThey were randomly assigned to receive PCdd [paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 and carboplatin, the area under the curve, (AUC)=3 on d 2] or ECdd-P (epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles) every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.\nThe primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS); the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety.\nResults\nThe intent-to-treat population included 143 patients (70 in the PCdd arm and 73 in the ECdd-P arm).\nCompared with the ECdd-P arm, the PCdd arm had significantly higher 3-year DFS [93.9% vs. 79.1%; hazard ratio (HR)=0.310; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank, P=0.005] and OS (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028).\nWorse neutropenia (grade 3/4) was found in the ECdd-P than the PCdd arm (47.9% vs. 21.4%, P=0.001).\nConclusions\nPCdd was superior to ECdd-P as an adjuvant chemotherapy for early TNBC with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS.\nPCdd also yielded lower hematological toxicity.\nThus, PCdd might be a preferred regimen for early TNBC patients with a high recurrence risk.\nIntroduction\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2).\nTNBCs, which account for approximately 12%\u221220% of all invasive breast cancers, are resistant to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy; their aggressive behavior and poor prognosis make them one of the most challenging cancers to treat.\nPostoperative adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, which is an important part of comprehensive treatment, can reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis.\nAt present, since the use of polygenic prognostic detection in domestic hospitals is low, the decision of adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer patients is relatively conservative.\nThe clinical application of an anthracycline sequential taxane regimen and aromatase inhibitors has also reached an expert consensus.\nSystemic chemotherapy is generally recommended by guidelines and is, thus, currently considered as a mainstay of TNBC management.\nHowever, the proposed chemotherapy regimens remain controversial.\nIn routine clinical practice, anthracycline and taxane-containing regimens are the most commonly used systemic cytotoxic regimens for TNBC patients.\nAdding platinum to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens not only substantially increases the pathological complete response (pCR) rate but may also improve the event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients according to previous trials.\nPlatinum-based neoadjuvant\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0may be recommended as an option in\u00a0TNBC\u00a0patients with the cost of higher hematological toxicity incidence.\nHowever, there is limited direct evidence regarding an appropriate platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy.\nFurthermore, determination of the optimal regimen balancing well-tolerated adverse toxicity with high efficacy is difficult.\nUnderlying genetic conditions appear to play an important role in TNBC.\nBRCA1-positive tumors show distinct clinic pathological characteristics.\nSeventy percent of all BRCA1-positive breast cancers and up to 23% of BRCA2 carriers have a TNBC phenotype.\nTNBC tumors with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation are associated with a better response to DNA-damaging systemic regimens such as the platinum agents.\nDose-dense chemotherapy (i.e., a chemotherapy regimen in which each cycle has a shortened treatment interval) is associated with significant improvements in survival and has been considered for use in the adjuvant setting for TNBC.\nWith granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, dose-dense chemotherapy regimens at the optimal dose have been permitted at two-week intervals rather than the conventional three-week cycle in early breast cancer regimens.\nData supporting platinum-based adjuvant regimens for TNBC are scarce and are based mostly on retrospective research.\nGiven the lack of well-established prospective or randomized studies, we conducted this study to compare the efficacy and safety of dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PCdd) with those of the commonly used dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (ECdd-P) as adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in Chinese TNBC patients with high recurrence risk.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nThis was a randomized, open-label, single-center study conducted in Chinese females with TNBC at high recurrence risk.\nThe study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital (No. CH-BC-012).\nAll interventions were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, guidelines of the International Conference for Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice.\nThe study was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT01378533).\nParticipants\nAll participating patients provided written informed consent.\nFemale patients aged 18\u221265 years who had undergone primary breast surgery for confirmed ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible.\nER, PR and HER2 status were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on patients\u2019 tumor sections.\nThe IHC cutoff for ER-negative and PR-negative status was 1% or less positive tumor cells with nuclear staining.\nHER2-negative status was determined by IHC by giving a score of 0 or 1 or by the absence ofHER2 amplification (HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 and HER2 copies <4.0) upon fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.\nER, PR and HER2 analyses were performed centrally in a single laboratory of National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\nPatients were selected with positive axillary lymph or with other high-risk factors for recurrence (e.g., age <35 years, grade III disease, and intravascular cancer embolus).\nFurther details regarding this study protocol are available in the Supplementary Table S1.\nRandomization and masking\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either the PCdd or the ECdd-P regimen.\nSimple randomization was conducted with no stratification factors and was carried out by using\u00a0random allocation sequence.\nThe patients, medical staff, and investigators were aware of treatment allocation and assessing outcomes.\nProcedures\nPatients in both study arms received treatment in two-week cycles.\nPatients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles.\nPatients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles.\nProphylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg was administered during each cycle according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines in the dose-dense setting.\nToxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nSafety was monitored with adverse events (AEs) reports, physical examinations, regular laboratory tests and electrocardiogram assessments at the end of each cycle until the 30th day of the last follow-up cycle.\nOutcomes\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, which was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (in the absence of other primary malignancies).\nSecondary objectives included OS and safety.\nOS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.\nWe analyzed the DFS and OS in patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment (intention-to-treat population, ITT).\nIn the safety analysis, we evaluated the numbers and proportions of patients in each treatment arm who had any AEs, delay of chemotherapy, and dose reduction.\nAEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0).\nIn addition, we conducted exploratory subgroup analyses according to age (\u226440 vs. >40 years), Ki-67 index (\u226430 vs. >30), tumor size (<2 cm vs. \u22652 cm), nodal status (negative vs. positive), and surgery-chemotherapy interval (<30 dvs. \u226530 d) to investigate whether the treatment effect varied by subgroup.\nSample size computation\nThe sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate.\nAssuming an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 as a primary outcome in PCdd regimen (results of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion achieving 3-year DFS in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 participants (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power with an alpha level at 0.05, with a 5% dropout rate in each control/treatment arm.\nSince the censoring proportion during the course of the study might be higher than expected; therefore, the sample size was increased to 143 patients to ensure the target number of events would be reached in a reasonable time frame.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA).\nData were presented as numbers (%) or as the mean standard deviation.\nFrequency tables were analyzed by using the\u00a0\u03c72 test.\nThe survival analysis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method in the ITT population.\nThe hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model.\nPatients not showing progression were censored at the study cutoff date.\nThe multivariable Cox model was used for subgroup analysis to explore the influence of clinical characteristics on the 3-year DFS.\nThe safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and underwent at least one post-baseline safety assessment.\nA P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nPatients\nFrom June 2011 to December 2015, 143 patients were randomly enrolled in the PCdd arm (n=70) or the ECdd-P arm (n=73).\nAfter excluding 11 patients [treatment discontinuation due to tumor progression (n=1), withdrawal after chemotherapy (n=3), and lost to follow-up (n=7)], 132 patients who completed the planned eight cycles of chemotherapy were included in the per-protocol analysis (Figure 1).\nThe data cutoff for the primary analysis was November 30th, 2018.\nBaseline characteristics were balanced between arms (Table 1).\nAll enrolled patients had an Eastern\u00a0Cooperative\u00a0Oncology\u00a0Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0\u22121, and 62.2% were postmenopausal.\nThe median age was 49 (range, 22\u221264) years.\nIn total, 111 patients (77.6%) were aged older than 40 years.\nMost patients had stage II or III disease (n=92, 64.3%), and 90.9% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma.\nMore than 42% had T2\u2212T4 tumors, and 53 patients (37.1%) were clinically node positive.\nMore than 75% of patients had a Ki-67 proliferation index >30%.\nSurvival outcomes\nAs of cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up was 57.3 (range, 1.2\u221298.6) months, with 58.1 months in the PCdd arm and 56.1 months in the ECdd-P arm.\nIn total, 98 patients (74.2%) were followed up over 4 years.\nDuring the study period, 23 relapse events were recorded, 5 in the PCdd arm and 18 in the ECdd-P arm.\nMost events (96.2%) were observed during the first 3 years after first diagnosis.\nIn the full analysis of ITT population, patients had significantly fewer DFS events in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm (5 vs. 18; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank, P=0.005).\nThe 3-year DFS was 93.9% (95% CI, 88.2%\u221299.6%) in the PCdd arm and 79.1% (95% CI, 69.7\u221288.5%) in the ECdd-P arm.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves for DFS remained separated for the rest of the 3-year follow-up (Figure 2).\nData on OS were immature.\nEight patients died in the ECdd-P arm, whereas only one died in the PCdd arm; all deaths were cancer related.\nPreliminary data showed a potential trend on a higher 3-year OS rate in the PCdd arm (98.5% vs. 92.9%; HR=0.142; 95% CI, 0.060\u22120.825; log-rank, P=0.028) (Figure 3).\nSubgroup analyses showed a consistent DFS benefit in the PCdd arm, with the difference reaching statistical significance in the following subgroups: age >40 years (HR=4.31; 95% CI, 1.42\u221213.11; P=0.010), Ki-67 index >30% (HR=3.80; 95% CI, 1.08\u221213.36; P=0.038), and clinically evaluated lymph nodes (HR=5.73; 95% CI, 1.28\u221225.65; P=0.022) ( Figure 4).\nAEs\nOverall, both regimens were well tolerated with manageable AEs.\nThere were more patients who experienced chemotherapy delay [25 (35.7%) vs. 23 (31.5%), P=0.361] and dose reduction [16 (22.9%) vs. 14 (19.2%), P=0.369] in the PCdd arm than in the ECdd-P arm, but the difference was not significant (Table 2).\nThe most frequent AEs were neutropenia, nausea and emesis.\nThe incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the ECdd-P arm than that in the PCdd arm [35 (47.9%) vs. 15 (21.4%), P=0.001], while the incidence of other grade 3 and 4 AEs was similar between the two arms.\nThere was also no significant difference in the incidence of peripheral neuropathy between the two arms (Table 3).\nNo death or life-threatening event was recorded during the study or within 30 days after the last cycle of treatment.\nDiscussion\nThis open-label, randomized study achieved its primary endpoint, with a statistically significant difference in the 3-year DFS rate in patients randomized to receive PCdd as adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk early TNBC vs. ECdd-P (93.9% vs. 79.1%; HR=0.310; 95% CI, 0.137\u22120.704; log-rank P=0.005).\nFurther, PCdd was better tolerated than ECdd-P, with fewer hematological toxicities (grade 3/4) (21.4% and 47.9%, respectively).\nCollectively, these results indicate that PCdd might be an appropriate regimen for TNBC.\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving the 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of theBRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, as indicated herein by the clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety.\nTo our knowledge, this is an innovative randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of a dose-dense carboplatin-based regimen in the adjuvant setting for TNBC with high recurrence risk.\nTNBC may be more sensitive to platinum-based regimens.\nCarboplatin increased the pCR rate from 41% to 54% in the CALGB40603 trial and from 36.9% to 53.2% in the GeparSixto trial.\nIn the GeparSixto study, the improved pCR rate significantly increased the 3-year DFS rate from 76.1% to 85.8% (HR=0.56; 95% CI, 0.33\u22120.96; P=0.024).\nHowever, in the CALGB40603 study, the 5-year distant recurrence-free interval was 76.3% with no significant difference.\nThe randomized phase III clinical trial EA 1131 (NCT02445391) has also been designed to prove the efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with residual TNBC.\nThe BrighTNess study has also confirmed that carboplatin-containing regimen appears to have a favorable risk-to-benefit profile for patients with high-risk TNBC in the neoadjuvant setting.\nHowever, the clinical benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC has not been well-investigated.\nFor an adjuvant scenario, a retrospective, single-center study in a Swiss breast cancer center reported a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 90% in patients treated with carboplatin.\nIn the present study, the PCdd regimen achieved significantly better survival benefit (3-year DFS and OS rates) for TNBC patients in the adjuvant setting compared with historical data from standard chemotherapy regimens (60%\u221280% with taxane-based regimens, 65%\u221285% with anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy, and 83.7% with anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab).\nA dose-dense regimen has been hypothesized to minimize residual tumor burden compared to dose escalation and serve as a more effective method for high-risk breast cancer.\nIn the CALGB9741 trial, the 4-year DFS rate was 82% in the dose-dense group.\nA previous study from our institution also compared the epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (EC-P) or epirubicin plus paclitaxel (EP) dose-dense group and the EP regular group regarding postoperative adjuvant treatment for high-risk breast cancer.\nThe dose-dense group had higher 3-year RFS rates (84.1% vs. 80.0%, P=0.501) and OS rates (95.6% vs. 90.0%, P=0.153).\nOur trial is a novel prospective study showing significant improvements in the 3-year DFS and OS rates by using a dose-dense anthracycline-free platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for TNBC regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThe 3-year DFS (93.9%) and OS (98.5%) rates in the PCdd arm were also superior to those of a dose-dense regimen reported by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).\nAlthough the survival data in our study are immature at present, a relatively long follow-up time will allow us to report a beneficial trend in OS.\nIn addition, these data are comparable to previous data on anthracycline- and taxane-based dose-dense regimens.\nBecause the TNBC phenotype is closely associated with hereditary breast cancer, the administration of platinum-based regimens has received a new impetus.\nHowever, in the Chinese population, BRCA1/2 mutations are prevalent in only 10.5% of TNBC patients younger than 50 years.\nThe benefit of adjuvant carboplatin in TNBC with BRCA1/2 mutation(s) is still controversial.\nThe GeparSixto trial showed that carboplatin is more effective in TNBC patients; however, a secondary analysis of the GeparSixto demonstrated that TNBC patients without BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations would also benefit from the addition of carboplatin, which increased the DFS rate (85.3% in the carboplatin group and 73.5% in the non-carboplatin group; HR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.29\u22120.96; P=0.04).\nThe BRCA1/2 mutation status plays an important role for tumor identification in TNBC patients with higher response rate of platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy.\nHowever, other studies have shown that the clinical use of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test may also have the potential to identify patients with TNBC that may respond to the treatment of DNA damage, in excess of those currently identified by gBRCA1/2 mutational screening.\nIt has been suggested that tumors carrying gBRCA mutations may be sensitive to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, including platinum.\nIn the present study, we found that for early TNBC patients, the addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel was superior to epirubicin plus paclitaxel with respect to the 3-year DFS among BRCA1/2 unselected patients.\nTo analyze the trends in adjuvant regimens for TNBC and to explore the factors influencing efficacy, we demonstrated that patients aged >40 years, with Ki-67 index >30%, and clinically evaluated lymph nodes were found to have a survival advantage from the PCdd regimen.\nFuture refinement of platinum-sensitive subgroups for targeting specific tumor biomarkers in TNBC is warranted ().\nWith respect to tolerance, previous trials showed a high incidence of AEs and an increasing discontinuation rate for dose-dense chemotherapy of TNBC.\nThe PCdd regimen, which yields fewer adverse toxicities, may be considered a better alternative for the high-risk group of patients in our study, particularly for older patients.\nThe toxicity profile in our study was as anticipated: gastrointestinal toxic effects were more common in the PCdd arm, while grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was more common in the ECdd-P arm.\nAll gastrointestinal toxic effects were manageable and self-limiting.\nThese findings indicate that the PCdd regimen can be recommended to reduce unnecessary toxicities.\nOur study has some limitations, including its small sample size and the potential investigator bias from a single-center institutional experience.\nFurther, we had limited statistical power to show a significant OS benefit.\nA longer follow-up time is necessary, and the median OS should be further evaluated.\nIn addition, given the financial and technical limitations during the study period, the BRCA mutation status was not analyzed to identify whether the gBRCA subgroup will benefit from the PCdd regimen.\nFurther prospective trials to evaluate other platinum-based regimens in the adjuvant setting for TNBC are warranted, particularly to define a sensitive population.\nAn ongoing phase III trial in National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCT03876886 at http://ClinicalTrials.gov) might provide further insight to evaluate the incorporation of platinum in the adjuvant setting, to detect HRD, and to identify specific TNBC patients who might benefit from carboplatin-based therapy.\nConclusions\nPCdd not only is superior to ECdd-P as adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to improving 3-year DFS and OS rates but also yields lower chemotherapy-related toxicities in early TNBC patients regardless of the BRCA mutation status.\nThus, PCdd might be a beneficial standard adjuvant regimen for early TNBC patients at a high recurrence risk, with clinically meaningful improvement in survival and safety data.\nFlow diagram of study design.

The trial includes two groups: ECdd-P and PCdd.\nEligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the PCdd group or the ECdd-P group. Randomization was conducted with no stratification factors. Eligible patients will be continually enrolled into the study until the total number of patients reached the planned sample size. The patients, medical staff and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. Sample size was determined based on a superiority test of 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of an approximate higher proportion of 0.10 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level, with a 10% dropout rate (5% in each control/treatment arm). The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). Primary and secondary efficacy analyses include the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of all randomly assigned patients. The safety analysis population includes all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.\n\nEligibility | Inclusion criteria: 1) Patient must accept the primary breast surgery; 2) Patients with histologically confirmed ER (\u2212), PR (\u2212) and HER2 (\u2212),i.e., <1% positive tumor cells with nuclear staining in IHC and no HER2 overexpression; 3) Positive axillary lymph nodes; negative axillary lymph node with age <35 years or III grade or intravascular cancer embolus; 4) Age between 18 years to 65 years; 5) Able to give informed consent; 6) Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1; 7) Not pregnant, and on appropriate birth control if of child-bearing potential; 8) Adequate bone marrow reserve with ANC >1.5\u00d710 9/L and platelets >100\u00d710 9/L; 9) Adequate renal function with serum creatinine <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal; 10) Adequate hepatic reserve with serum bilirubin <2.0\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, AST/ALT <2\u00d7 the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase < 5\u00d7 the upper limit of normal. Serum bilirubin >2.0 is acceptable in the setting of known Gilbert\u2019s syndrome; and 11) No active major medical or psychosocial problems that could be complicated by study participation.\nExclusion criteria: 1) Received neo-adjuvant therapy; 2) cardiac dysfunction documented by an ejection fraction less than the lower limit of the facility normal by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan, or 45% by echocardiogram; 3) uncontrolled medical problems; 4) evidence of active acute or chronic infection; 5) pregnant or breast feeding; or 6) hepatic, renal or bone marrow dysfunction as detailed above.\n\nSample size calculation | The target sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e., 3-year DFS rate. To detect a difference of 0.13 between the two regimens (result of our preliminary clinical research demonstrated the proportion surviving in the ECdd-P regimen was 80.0%), an overall sample size of 133 subjects (66 in the ECdd-P arm and 67 in the PCdd arm) was calculated to achieve 80.0% power at a one-sided 0.050 significance level. The accrual pattern across time periods was uniform (all periods equal). The proportion of drop out in the control and treatment group was 0.1000 (each 0.05).\nRandomization | Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised under concealment, by the study lead investigator (Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), according to prespecified randomisation number lists to receive ECdd-P or PCdd.\nTreatment | Administration: Patients in both study groups received treatment in 14-day cycles. Patients assigned to the PCdd arm received paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 on d 1 plus carboplatin AUC=3 on d 2 for 8 cycles. Patients assigned to the ECdd-P arm received epirubicin 80 mg/m2 divided in 2 d and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on d 1 for 4 cycles. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Prophylactic G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 was given for each chemotherapy cycle.\n\nSafety assessments and dose modifications | Safety assessments included 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital sign taking and clinical laboratory evaluations every cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each treatment cycle until 28 follow-up d after the end of study visit. Toxicity was graded by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0). Febrile neutropenia was managed according to institutional treatment guidelines in China. Toxicities were managed through dose delays of up to 3 weeks, and dose reductions were permitted in the following events: grade 4 hematological, grade 3 or 4 non-hematological, or other protocol-specified toxic effects.\nStudy drugs | Drug: epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin, G-CSF epirubicin 80 mg/m2 iv divide in 2 d cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 iv d 1 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d74 cycles paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 iv d 1 carboplatin AUC=3 iv d 2 G-CSF 3 \u00b5g/kg in d 5\u22129 q14d \u00d78 cycles.\n\nConcomitant medications | 1. Antiemetics can be prescribed to patients who are vomiting due to administration of treatment drug(s);\n2. Patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy can be treated with neurotropic supplements such as duloxetine, vitamin B, etc.;\n3. Analgesics can be used for patients who have pain affecting quality of life;\n4. Patients with constipation, diarrhea, or other conditions can be treated using appropriate medication for their respective condition;\n5. Prophylactic antiemetic measures, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone, were allowed.\n6. Premedication with dexamethasone and histamine antagonists was administered before paclitaxel to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nOutcome measures | Primary outcome measure:\nThe primary endpoint is 3-year DFS rate. DFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first local/distant recurrence (without second primary malignancies), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\nSecondary outcome measures:\nSecondary endpoints include 3-year OS (defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause) and safety of the treatment. Toxicity was graded by using the NCI- CTCAE, version 3.0.\n\nSafety parameters | AEs, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests\nStatistical analysis | All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (Version 22.0; IBM Corp., New York, USA). Data on clinical characteristics, chemotherapy, recurrence, and survival were analyzed. Data were presented as the number (%) or the mean standard deviation. Continuous variables were compared using the Student\u2019s t test, while categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact test.\nThe proportion of patients remaining event-free over time will be displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using a two-sided log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe safety population will include all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. For safety analysis, AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Analysis of AEs will be based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs are AEs not present prior to medical treatment, or are already present and worsen either in intensity or frequency following treatment. The incidence rate of TEAEs will be described according to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Meanwhile, serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to study discontinuation will be similarly summarized and tabulated. Laboratory tests will be analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis.\n\nFollow-up | All treated patients will be followed-up with once every 3 months to collect survival information for DFS and OS. Patients who discontinue treatment due to any causes will be followed-up with once every 3 months until disease recurrence or death. After disease recurrence, patient follow up can be conducted by phone or as general clinical visits until death.\n\n\nBaseline characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancer\nVariable | ECdd-P arm (N=73) [n (%)] | PCdd arm (N=70) [n (%)] | P\nECdd-P, dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; PCdd, dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin; IDC, invasive ductal carcinoma; ILC, invasive lobular carcinoma; MRM, modified radical mastectomy; BCS, breast conservative surgery; SLN, simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy; SCI, surgery chemotherapy interval.\nAge [mean (range)] (year) | 46 (26\u221264) | 49 (22\u221263) | 0.216\n\u3000\u226440 | 20 (27.4) | 12 (17.1) | 0.163\n\u3000>40 | 53 (72.6) | 58 (82.9) | \nMenopause at diagnosis |  |  | \n\u3000Post-menopause | 50 (68.5) | 39 (55.7) | 0.124\n\u3000Pre-menopause | 23 (31.5) | 31 (44.3) | \nPathology |  |  | 0.114\n\u3000IDC | 63 (86.3) | 67 (95.7) | \n\u3000ILC | 2 (2.7) | 0 (0) | \n\u3000Other type | 8 (11.0) | 3 (4.3) | \nTumor size (cm) |  |  | 0.179\n\u3000<2 | 27 (37.0) | 34 (48.6) | \n\u3000\u22652 | 46 (63.0) | 36 (51.4) | \nLymph node metastasis |  |  | 0.604\n\u3000Yes | 29 (39.7) | 24 (34.3) | \n\u3000No | 44 (60.3) | 46 (65.7) | \nIntravascular cancer embolus |  |  | 0.167\n\u3000Yes | 16 (21.9) | 10 (14.3) | \n\u3000No | 57 (78.1) | 60 (85.7) | \nNuclear grade |  |  | 0.999\n\u3000Grade 1, 2 | 23 (31.5) | 22 (31.4) | \n\u3000Grade 3 | 50 (68.5) | 48 (68.6) | \nKi-67 |  |  | 0.108\n\u3000\u226430 | 12 (16.4) | 20 (28.6) | \n\u3000>30 | 61 (83.6) | 50 (71.4) | \nTNM stage |  |  | 0.104\n\u3000I | 24 (32.9) | 27 (38.6) | \n\u3000II/III | 49 (67.1) | 43 (61.4) | \nType of surgery |  |  | 0.309\n\u3000MRM | 57 (78.1) | 54 (77.1) | \n\u3000BCS | 13 (17.8) | 9 (12.9) | \n\u3000SLN | 3 (4.1) | 7 (10.0) | \nRadiotherapy |  |  | 0.141\n\u3000Yes | 42 (57.5) | 33 (47.1) | \n\u3000No | 31 (42.5) | 37 (52.9) | \nSCI (d) |  |  | 0.609\n\u3000<30 | 47 (64.4) | 42 (60.0) | \n\u3000\u226530 | 26 (35.6) | 28 (40.0) | \n\n\nTreatment exposure in TNBC patients treated with ECdd-P/PCdd chemotherapy\nVariables | n (%) | P\nECdd-P Arm (N=73) | PCdd Arm (N=70)\nTNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; ECdd-P, dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel; PCdd, dose-dense paclitaxel plus carboplatin.\nFollow-up time [Median (range)] (month) | 56.1 (2.8\u221298.6) | 58.1 (1.2\u221276.6) | 0.320\nNumber of chemotherapy cycles |  |  | \n\u3000Total | 573 | 552 | \n\u3000Median | 8 (3\u22128) | 8 (2\u22128) | 0.783\nDelay of chemotherapy |  |  | 0.361\n\u3000Yes | 23 (31.5) | 25 (35.7) | \n\u3000No | 50 (68.5) | 45 (64.3) | \nDose reduction |  |  | 0.369\n\u3000Yes | 14 (19.2) | 16 (22.9) | \n\u3000No | 59 (80.8) | 54 (77.1) | \n\n\nCommon adverse events in TNBC patients treated with ECdd-P/PCdd chemotherapy\nAdverse events | n (%) | P*\nECdd-P arm (n=73) | PCdd arm (n=70)\nA patient could have experienced more than one specific toxicity.
