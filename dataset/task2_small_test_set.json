            "Single-dose mebendazole is widely used in preventive chemotherapy against the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura, yet it shows limited efficacy against hookworm and T. trichiura infections.",

            "185 children completed treatment and provided follow-up stool samples.",
            "CR against hookworm was significantly higher in the multiple dose (98%) than in the single dose arm (13%, OR 389.1, 95% CI 95.2 to 2885.7%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). 34 and 42 children reported mild adverse events in the single and multiple dose arms, respectively.",

            "This is the first double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing the effect of a single dose (500 mg) to a multiple dose (100 mg twice a day during three consecutive days) of mebendazole against hookworm infections in Pemba, Tanzania, a setting with high drug pressure and persistent high hookworm prevalence.",
            "The results of this study clearly showed that the multiple mebendazole dose is more effective than the single dose.",
            "Both regimens were safe with only mild adverse events being reported.",
            "Implications of all the available evidence",
            "Currently, the main control strategy against hookworm and other soil-transmitted helminths is preventive chemotherapy, which is based on the administration a single dose of either mebendazole or albendazole.",
            "Our study confirms that the curative effect of a single dose mebendazole is not sufficient for treating hookworm infections and that alternative, more effective treatments, as a multiple dose mebendazole regimens might be considered, in particular in persistent hotspot settings.",
            "Alt-text: Unlabelled Box",
            "Introduction",
            "An estimated 472 million people are infected with hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus).",
            "Hookworm disease burden is mainly associated with anaemia, which can cause both physical and intellectual growth retardation among preschool- and school-aged children.",
            "In 2016, 1.6 million DALYs were estimated to be caused by hookworm infections, leading to annual productivity losses of up to US$139 billion.",
            "Currently, the control of hookworm and other soil-transmitted helminths is based on periodic deworming (so called preventive chemotherapy) of school-aged children and other high-risk groups by regularly administering a single dose of either albendazole (400\u202fmg) or mebendazole (500\u202fmg).",
            "Both drugs are highly effective against Ascaris lumbricoides but show poor performance against Trichuris trichiura when administered as a single dose.",
            "Moreover, based on a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis, a single dose of albendazole shows acceptable efficacy against hookworm (CR\u202f=\u202f80%), while a single dose of mebendazole fails to clear most of these infections (CR\u202f=\u202f33%).",
            "The main anthelmintic drugs available to the control programmes are, therefore, variably efficacious depending on the drug and parasite.",
            "Additionally, there are worries that drug resistance will emerge, a problem commonly described in veterinary medicine.",
            "With preventive chemotherapy being the predominant tool for helminthiasis control, it might not be surprising that soil-transmitted helminthiasis persists in many settings.",
            "As an example, recent studies on Pemba Island reported that prevalence of hookworm continues to range at high levels from 36 to 97%, despite regular treatment of school-aged children.",
            "Therefore, additional strategies are required to control and eliminate soil-transmitted helminth infections, including access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as adapted treatment regimens, such as optimised dosing or combination chemotherapy which would improve drug therapy.",
            "A multiple dose (100\u202fmg twice per day over three consecutive days) treatment of mebendazole is recommended globally and in Tanzania for individual treatment.",
            "However, surprisingly, only a few small studies have evaluated the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole.",
            "Moreover, results obtained varied considerably with cure rates (CRs) ranging from 31 to 100% and, therefore, did not allow drawing final treatment recommendations.",
            "Finally, only a single study evaluated both treatment arms in an open label trial design, more than 15\u202fyears ago.",
            "No high quality clinical trial conducted to date did a side-by-side comparison of multiple dose versus single dose treatment of mebendazole.",
            "Thus, the present trial is, to our knowledge, the first randomised, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a single dose (500\u202fmg) to a multiple dose (six doses of 100\u202fmg over three consecutive days twice per day) regimen of mebendazole against hookworm.",
            "Methods",
            "Study Design and Participants",
            "This randomised, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at Piki Primary School, on Pemba Island, Tanzania, from July 24 to September 15, 2017.",
            "Prior to the study initiation, ethical approval was obtained from the Zanzibar Medical Research and Ethical Committee (ZAMREC, reference number 0002/May/17) and from the Ethics Committee of Northern and Central Switzerland (EKNZ, reference number 2017-00320).",
            "This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03245398.",
            "Before enrolment, all caregivers of children aged 6\u201312\u202fyears attending the primary school of Piki village were invited to information sessions at school during which the research staff explained the purpose and procedures of the study, as well as the benefits and potential risks of participating.",
            "Caregivers had the chance to clarify any questions they may had before they were asked whether they wanted their child to be included in the study or not.",
            "Caregivers who chose to allow the participation of their child were asked to sign a written informed consent.",
            "Illiterate caregivers provided a thumbprint while an impartial witness signed to verify that all information in the informed consent form was conveyed appropriately.",
            "Consenting children were eligible if they had provided two stool samples, were positive for hookworm eggs in the stool (\u2265\u00a0100 eggs per gram [EPG] or at least two Kato-Katz thick smears slides with more than one hookworm egg).",
            "After the initial clinical examination, children were excluded from the trial if any of the following exclusion criteria were present: had menarche (for females); presence of severe anaemia (haemoglobin <\u00a08.0\u202fg/dl was considered severe anaemia); had any known or reported history of chronic illness such as cancer, diabetes, chronic heart, liver or renal disease; received any recent anthelminthic treatment (within past 4\u202fweeks); had any known allergy to mebendazole or albendazole.",
            "Randomisation and Masking",
            "The trial statistician (JH), who was not involved in any field work, provided a computer-generated stratified (by baseline infection intensities) block randomisation code (blocks of size ten).",
            "Participants were allocated 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms: single dose (500\u202fmg) or multiple dose (100\u202fmg twice a day during three consecutive days) of mebendazole.",
            "500\u202fmg and 100\u202fmg mebendazole tablets were obtained from  (Zug, Switzerland).",
            "Matching placebos were manufactured at the  (100\u202fmg mebendazole matching placebo) or purchased at Fagron, Germany (500\u202fmg mebendazole matching placebo).",
            "Trial medications were prepared in advance in identical plastic envelopes labelled with the children's unique treatment identification numbers and sealed.",
            "The treatment lasted 3\u202fdays and children received tablets at six different time points (mornings and evenings of each of the 3\u202fdays).",
            "At the first time point, all participants received two tablets: either 500\u202fmg mebendazole plus 100\u202fmg mebendazole matching placebo, or 500\u202fmg mebendazole matching placebo and 100\u202fmg mebendazole; at the remaining five time points, children only received one tablet: either 100\u202fmg mebendazole or matching placebo, depending to which treatment arm they were allocated.",
            "Participants, investigators, caregivers, outcome assessors and the trial statistician were blinded.",
            "Allocation was concealed: the envelopes containing the drugs were in bags of ten and, within each group of ten, envelopes were stacked on each other, preventing the administrator from seeing the next envelope.",
            "Study Procedures",
            "The name, age, sex and school grade of eligible children were recorded.",
            "Children received containers labelled with their unique identification number (ID) and were asked to provide two stool samples, preferably on consecutive days.",
            "Stool samples were transferred to the Public Health Laboratory Ivo de Carneri where duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear slides were prepared from each sample.",
            "Slides were examined by experienced laboratory technicians under a light microscope within 1\u202fh after slide preparation, to avoid clearing of hookworm eggs.",
            "Helminth eggs were enumerated and recorded for each parasite (hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura) separately.",
            "To ensure quality of hookworm diagnosis, 10% of the samples were divided into two stool containers; one of the containers kept its original participant ID, whereas the second container was labelled with a new ID (assigned by the co-investigator).",
            "Duplicate Kato-Katz were prepared from both containers and the findings compared.",
            "Quality control for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura consisted of re-reading 10% of all slides.",
            "Any discrepancies between the original and the quality control read were discussed.",
            "All children found positive for hookworm underwent a physical and clinical examination by a physician.",
            "Height was measured with a standard meter (to the nearest 0.1\u202fcm), weight with an electronic balance (to the nearest 0.1\u202fkg), and temperature using an electronic ear thermometer (to the nearest 0.1\u202f\u00b0C).",
            "Haemoglobin levels were measured in capillary blood using the finger-prick method (HemoCue\u00ae 301).",
            "Children were examined for any acute or chronic illness and questioned about their medical history.",
            "Eligible children were enrolled (by MSP) for treatment which took place at Piki Primary school during the 3\u202fdays following the physical and clinical examination.",
            "Children received treatment with clean water and a package of biscuits.",
            "After every morning treatment children were monitored for 3\u202fh and then actively questioned for adverse events by the study physician and nurses using a questionnaire.",
            "The same procedure took place 24 and 48\u202fh after every morning treatment.",
            "At follow-up, between 18 to 22\u202fdays after treatment, another two stool samples were collected from each treated child.",
            "Participants who remained infected with hookworm, A. lumbricoides and/or T. trichiura at the end of the study were treated with albendazole (400\u202fmg).",
            "Similarly, children who did not fulfil the eligibility criteria but were found infected with at least one of the parasites during screening were treated with albendazole.",
            "Outcomes",
            "The primary outcome of this study was the CR against hookworm 20\u202fdays (\u00b1\u00a03\u202fdays) after treatment using the Kato-Katz thick smear method.",
            "CR was defined as percentage of hookworm-positive children being negative at follow-up.",
            "Secondary outcomes were (i) egg reduction rate (ERR) against hookworm, (ii) CR and ERR against A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, and (iii) tolerability (number of adverse events) assessed 3, 24 and 48\u202fh post-treatment.",
            "An additional secondary outcome, which will not be addressed in the current manuscript, was caregiver's knowledge related to the clinical trial after attending an information session.",
            "This outcome was assessed using a short questionnaire.",
            "Sample Size",
            "A CR of 20% was assumed for the single dose mebendazole and a CR of 40% was assumed for the multiple dose treatment regimen.",
            "To detect a difference with 80% power at a two-sided 5% significance level, a minimum of 79 participants per study arm was required.",
            "Accounting for a loss to follow-up of 12%, we obtained a final sample size of 180 participants (90 per arm).",
            "Statistical Analysis",
            "Data were double entered by two staff members into a database (Access 2003, Microsoft) and crosschecked using the Data Compare tool of EpiInfo version 3.3.2.",
            "Any discrepancies between both data entries were resolved by consulting the original records.",
            "Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 (StataCorp) and R 3.4.3 (R Development Core Team).",
            "Only children who submitted samples before and after treatment were included in the available case analysis, which followed intention to treat principles.",
            "Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using unadjusted (primary analysis) and adjusted logistic regression (adjustment for age, sex, weight and strata).",
            "For ERR calculation, the mean egg count of the four Kato-Katz thick smears was multiplied by a factor of 24 to calculate the EPG.",
            "ERR was defined as the percentage of mean reduction at follow-up compared to baseline.",
            "ERR was calculated using both the geometric mean (GM) and the arithmetic mean (AM).",
            "Confidence intervals for ERRs were calculated using the bootstrap resampling method with 5000 replicates.",
            "The significance level was set at p-value\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05.",
            "Infection intensities (light, moderate or heavy) were determined according to WHO cut-offs.",
            "Role of Funding Source",

            "Results",
            "364 consenting participants were screened for hookworm.",
            "354 children provided two baseline stool samples.",
            "Of these, 206 were found hookworm positive and were invited for the clinical and physical examination.",
            "Two children were excluded because they had haemoglobin levels below 8.0\u202fg/dl and 18 were absent from school on the clinical and physical examination day.",
            "The remaining 186 children were present for treatment and 93 participants were randomly allocated to each treatment arm.",
            "One child from the single dose of mebendazole arm was lost to follow-up because he/she was not on Pemba Island during the follow-up period.",
            "With the exception of 11 children, who provided the second baseline stool sample between six and 19\u202fdays after the first sample, both stool samples from all other children were collected within a five-day window.",
            "All remaining 185 participants who provided follow-up stool samples were included in the available case analysis (Fig. 1).",
            "At the second treatment time point, two children's envelopes were swapped.",
            "Therefore, by the end of the six-treatment time points, one child had erroneously received 100\u202fmg of mebendazole in addition to the single dose of 500\u202fmg of mebendazole plus placebo and the other child received only five doses instead of six doses of 100\u202fmg of mebendazole plus 100\u202fmg of placebo.",
            "These two subjects were included in the available case analysis but excluded from the per protocol analysis (n\u202f=\u202f183) (Appendices 1 and 2).",

            "2.",
            "Discussion",
            "Preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay of helminthiases control, since it remains among the most cost-effective global public health control measures.",
            "Albendazole and mebendazole, which are variably efficacious against the different soil-transmitted helminths, are the most widely used drugs.",
            "We were interested in learning whether treatment efficacy could be improved by an adapted treatment regimen in a setting such as Pemba Island which, even though community members have been receiving treatment once or twice a year for 25\u202fyears, is still characterised by intense helminth transmission and persisting high prevalence rates.",
            "Using a double-blind trial design we evaluated the multiple dose (3\u202fday, 6 dose course) treatment of mebendazole, which is recommended globally and in Tanzania for individual treatment, versus the single dose regimen widely used for population-based treatment.",
            "We found clear evidence that the multiple, six-dose treatment schedule of mebendazole is significantly more effective at curing hookworm infections than a single dose of mebendazole.",
            "In our trial, only 13% of children were cured after a 500\u202fmg single dose of mebendazole.",
            "On the other hand, the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole cured almost all hookworm-infected children (CR\u202f=\u202f98%) which is in agreement with exploratory studies in the early 1970s.",
            "To our knowledge, only four RCTs, conducted in Iran, Thailand, Brazil and Papua New Guinea, assessed the effect of the multiple dose mebendazole on hookworm infections.",
            "In these studies, CRs ranged from 35 to 94%.",
            "Although these studies reported different baseline infection intensities, there seems to be no correlation between the intensity of infection and CRs.",
            "Concerns have been raised that mebendazole resistance had developed in the setting of Pemba since reduced efficacy of this drug was observed.",
            "In more detail, treatment of hookworm infections resulted in significantly lower cure (7.6%) and ERR (52.1%) in 2003 than the ones reported before the beginning of periodic chemotherapy (CR\u202f=\u202f22.4%, ERR\u202f=\u202f82.4%).",
            "However, our findings clearly demonstrate that with using the recommended treatment regimen (which does not include dose intensification or dose density of chemotherapy, strategies commonly employed for example in the treatment of cancer) for mebendazole, high efficacy against hookworm can still be obtained and that speculations on drug resistance of mebendazole against hookworm should therefore be considered with caution.",
            "On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the above mentioned strategies of dose intensification did not result in higher efficacy of mebendazole against soil-transmitted helminth infections.",
            "For example, RCTs evaluating the effect of 500\u202fmg of mebendazole daily for 3\u202fdays (1500\u202fmg in total) found CRs ranging of 26 to 59%.",
            "Thus, the higher dose does not seem to be the most important determinant driving the drug's effect.",
            "Overall, the hookworm CR for single dose mebendazole we observed on Pemba Island (13%) is in line with results from RCTs conducted in the same setting, however is considerably lower than a CR of 33% calculated from 13 trials in a recent meta-analysis.",
            "This discrepancy between our results and the summary estimate by means of meta-analysis could be due to several factors such as the diagnostic method used, the parasite strain, or the study location: three of the four RCTs which reported CRs below 20% following a single dose of mebendazole against hookworm took place on Pemba Island.",
            "Another influencing factor could be study quality and the sample size: the two RCTs reporting highest CRs using the single dose had small sample sizes of 35 and 45 participants in the single dose mebendazole arms.",
            "Our study showed that the multiple dose of mebendazole was also considerably more effective against T. trichiura infections than the single 500\u202fmg dose.",
            "Not only CRs were higher (CR\u202f=\u202f42.9% versus CR\u202f=\u202f6.8% respectively) but moderate infection intensities were less commonly observed in the multiple dose arm.",
            "Our results for the multiple dose regimen against T. trichiura are in line with previous studies conducted in Papua New Guinea and Brazil (CR\u202f=\u202f65% and CR\u202f=\u202f39%).",
            "However, similarly to what we found for the efficacy on hookworm, our results for the single dose were markedly lower than summary estimates reported by Moser and colleagues (CR\u202f=\u202f42%).",
            "Unlike the other two parasites, a multiple dose of mebendazole does not present an advantage against A. lumbricoides infections over a single mebendazole dose.",
            "Overall, both mebendazole treatments were well tolerated.",
            "Interestingly, available data on adverse events following multiple mebendazole doses is sparse.",
            "None of the three RCTs which tested the efficacy of the multiple dose mebendazole regimen documented information on adverse events.",
            "Headache, abdominal pain or diarrhoea were most commonly reported in both treatment arms, which is in line with previous studies exploring the efficacy and safety of 500\u202fmg mebendazole.",
            "In the current study, we found a sudden increase in the number of adverse events 48\u202fh after the last treatment which is rather unexpected due to the short half-life of mebendazole (in the range of 2\u20139\u202fh).",
            "For comparison, Speich et al. assessed adverse events at 3, 24, 27 and 48\u202fh post-treatment following a single dose of mebendazole and found the peak number of symptoms at 24\u202fh.",
            "It is important to highlight that the same trend was observed in both treatment arms (hence 48\u202fh and 96\u202fh after the last active treatment), which suggests that this finding might not be triggered by the treatment but rather by differences in the reporting.",
            "One limitation of this study is that the Kato-Katz technique has low sensitivity, particularly for light infections.",
            "As an effort to overcome this limitation, two stool samples were collected on different days and two slides were prepared from each sample.",
            "However, this may still result in an overestimation of CRs as light infections at follow-up might have been missed and falsely considered as cured.",
            "Additionally, the collection of two follow-up samples from 11 children was spaced by more than 5\u202fdays.",
            "Although there is no literature on the issue of how many days between sample collection are recommendable, this could had some impact on the outcome.",
            "In conclusion, our study has shown that the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole is unarguably more effective against hookworm and concomitant T. trichiura infections.",
            "The findings of our study add to recent results demonstrating that adapted treatments, including improved dosages, regimen or drug combinations considerably increase and broaden the spectrum of activity against soil-transmitted helminth infections.",
            "A multiple dose regimen clearly involves more resources than the administration of a single dose or drug combinations and comes with additional logistic challenges.",
            "However, in hotspot settings such as Pemba Island where the prevalences of hookworm and T. trichiura are so high despite decades of treatment, this could be a strategy to consider.",
            "In the framework of preventive chemotherapy, drugs are distributed by non-medical personnel (such as teachers, volunteers or community drug distributors) in non-medical settings such as schools.",
            "Thus, although more challenging, teachers could provide six doses instead of a single dose of mebendazole to each school-child.",
            "Improved treatments would trigger a considerable decrease of infections which would lead to a reduction of reservoirs that sustain reinfections in the population.",
            "In parallel, efforts should continue to discover and develop novel drugs and vaccines, which n the long-term would aid in the elimination of these diseases.",

            "Author summary",
            "Why was this study done?",
            "In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV testing, care, and treatment programs have been widely scaled up over the past decade, but suboptimal outcomes across the HIV care continuum\u2014particularly with regards to timely linkage to and sustained retention in care\u2014compromise their effectiveness.",
            "Patients experience multiple barriers to linkage to and retention in HIV care including health system barriers, structural barriers, and behavioral barriers, yet prior studies have largely evaluated individual interventions targeting a single barrier to care.",
            "Our study was designed specifically to examine the effectiveness of a combination intervention strategy (CIS) composed of several scalable evidence-based interventions targeting the multiple and prevalent health system, structural and behavioral barriers that patients face across the HIV continuum.",
            "What did the researchers do and find?",
            "We randomly assigned 10 primary health facilities in the city of Maputo and Inhambane Province in Mozambique to provide the standard of care (SOC) or the CIS, which included point-of-care CD4 testing at the time of diagnosis, accelerated ART initiation, and short message service (SMS) health messages and appointment reminders.",
            "A pre\u2013post intervention 2-sample design was nested within the intervention arm to assess the effectiveness of CIS+, an enhanced version of the CIS that additionally included conditional non-cash financial incentives for linkage and retention.",
            "We enrolled 2,004 adults diagnosed with HIV in the voluntary counseling and testing clinics of participating health facilities, and compared the proportion who achieved a combined outcome of linkage to HIV care within 1 month of diagnosis and retention in care at 12 months across the 3 study groups.",
            "We found an increased likelihood of achieving the combined outcome in the CIS group compared to the SOC group, driven primarily by very large increases in same-day linkage, but no difference between the CIS+ and CIS groups.",
            "What do these findings mean?",
            "The CIS may help improve outcomes across the HIV care continuum in high-burden settings, particularly in the critical first step of timely linkage to care following diagnosis.",
            "Further research is needed to understand whether financial incentives can be optimized in this setting, given their effectiveness in enhancing other health outcomes.",
            "Introduction",
            "Although the extraordinary scale-up of HIV testing, care, and treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade has resulted in more than 19 million persons accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART), the effectiveness of these programs has been significantly hindered by high levels of attrition across the HIV care continuum.",
            "Observational studies and systematic reviews have repeatedly reported disturbing gaps in care as patients move from HIV testing clinics to HIV care clinics (i.e., linkage to care) and that patient dropout among those enrolled in HIV care is far too common, both before and after ART initiation (i.e., retention in care).",
            "Indeed, available data suggest that less than 1/3 of individuals who are diagnosed with HIV are successfully linked to and remain engaged in HIV care 12 months later.",
            "Barriers to timely linkage to and sustained retention in HIV care have been well documented, and include health system barriers (e.g., multiple HIV clinic visits for counseling and clinical and laboratory assessments prior to ART initiation), structural barriers (e.g., transport costs and distances, work and childcare constraints), and behavioral barriers (e.g., forgetting appointments, lack of understanding of required care).",
            "Prior studies have overwhelmingly evaluated individual interventions targeting a single barrier at a single point in the HIV care continuum such as mobile phone short message service (SMS) messaging to augment linkage to care following diagnosis, or point-of-care CD4 testing to enhance retention among patients enrolled in HIV care.",
            "However, it is increasingly recognized that multi-component approaches composed of several practical, evidence-based interventions that simultaneously target the multiple and recurrent barriers that patients face as they navigate across the HIV care continuum are needed to maximize individual and population health.",
            "Further, implementation science research that evaluates proposed multi-component approaches in real-world settings is needed to assess not only effectiveness, but also implementation outcomes including reach, adoption, and sustainability.",
            "To this end, we designed a combination intervention strategy (CIS) composed of several scalable evidence-based interventions targeting prevalent health system, structural, and behavioral barriers across the HIV care continuum, and determined its effect on a combined outcome of linkage to and retention in HIV care among adults newly diagnosed with HIV in Mozambique, while also collecting information on its implementation and potential for broader scale-up.",
            "Data regarding intervention feasibility and patient acceptability have been published, and thus we present here the effectiveness results.",
            "Because the interventions included in the CIS are expected to be implemented at the facility level, as opposed to targeted at specific individuals, should they be scaled up, we evaluated effectiveness using a cluster design, which best mirrors this implementation approach.",

            "Additionally, a pre\u2013post intervention 2-sample design was nested within the intervention arm to assess the additional effectiveness of an enhanced version of the CIS, referred to as CIS+.",
            "Consequently, the standard of care (SOC) arm enrolled 1 cohort of patients, while the intervention arm enrolled 2 sequential cohorts of patients (CIS and CIS+).",

            "The Maputo City Health Network has a total of 37 health facilities, 32 of which offered comprehensive HIV care and treatment services at the time of study implementation.",

            "Those found to be eligible for ART received at least 1 individual counseling session before initiating treatment.",
            "For ART-eligible patients, the time interval between enrollment in HIV care and ART initiation was estimated at 1\u20132 months at the time the study started.",
            "Participants initiating ART were requested to return every 2 weeks for the first month, at 2 months, at 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter.",
            "ART-ineligible patients were instructed to return at 6 months for repeat clinical evaluation and laboratory testing.",
            "Combination intervention strategy",
            "At facilities randomized to the intervention arm, we introduced 4 evidence-based interventions that simplified the clinic flow and encouraged linkage to and retention in care.",
            "These interventions targeted several known health system, structural, and behavioral barriers across the HIV care continuum, and were adapted for the on-the-ground realities\u2014including practice norms, physical space, and available staffing\u2014at the health facilities.",
            "First, we introduced Pima (Inverness Medical Innovations) CD4 assay machines in the VCT clinics to enable HIV testing counselors to provide real-time, point-of-care CD4 test results immediately following diagnosis, and thus addressed a health system barrier by reducing the number of visits required for CD4 testing.",
            "We also hypothesized that receipt of additional information on one\u2019s health at the time of diagnosis would advance patient understanding of the need for care, a documented behavioral barrier.",
            "All patients regardless of CD4 count were provided with a paper-based referral to on-site HIV services that included their CD4 count, and were instructed to present for their first clinical consultation within 1 week.",
            "Second, to address additional health system barriers, patients with Pima CD4 cell count \u2264 350 cells/mm3 were provided with accelerated ART initiation, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the HIV morbidity and mortality that contributes to significant attrition among ART-eligible patients.",
            "These individuals received an individual ART preparatory counseling session in the VCT clinic immediately following CD4 testing, on the day of diagnosis.",
            "Facility receptionists were instructed to expedite appointments for these patients when they presented to schedule their clinical consultations.",
            "Although the patients were directed to the laboratory to have their blood drawn for baseline laboratory tests required by national ART guidelines, clinicians were encouraged to initiate ART at the first clinical visit rather than await the results of the laboratory tests unless the patient presented with comorbid conditions.",
            "Patients who initiated ART received a 2-week supply and followed the visit schedule dictated by national guidelines, similar to the SOC procedures.",
            "Once baseline laboratory results were available, they were reviewed by clinic staff, and if abnormalities were noted, the participant was contacted to return to the clinic.",
            "Third, participants received health messages and appointment reminders via SMS messaging to address behavioral barriers associated with deferring care engagement and forgetting appointments.",
            "The messages were sent from the central study office to the participant\u2019s phone or to a friend or relative\u2019s phone per participant preference, and did not refer to HIV or a specific health facility or reveal any personal information.",
            "The health messages encouraged participants to care for their health, and were sent weekly for 1 month following diagnosis and then monthly (e.g., \u201cHi.",
            "Your health is the most important thing.",
            "Please remember to come to the health center for health services.\u201d).",
            "Appointment reminders were sent only to participants who linked to care at the diagnosing facility, and were sent 3\u20137 days before each scheduled clinic visit (e.g., \u201cHi.",
            "Your health is the most important thing.",
            "We expect to see you at your upcoming appointment scheduled for the day ___.\u201d).",
            "Participants were not asked to confirm receipt or reply to the messages.",
            "Finally, patients in the CIS+ cohort received the CIS interventions plus a series of non-cash financial incentives (FIs) in the form of prepaid cellular air-time cards to offset structural barriers associated with the direct and indirect costs of coming to the health facility to receive HIV care.",
            "Air-time cards rather than cash were selected as the incentive based on discussion with the Ministry of Health.",
            "Each card was valued at approximately US$5 and was provided conditionally upon the following achievements: linkage to care within 1 month of diagnosis, retention in care 6 months after diagnosis, and retention in care 12 months after diagnosis, for a total of approximately US$15.",
            "Participants who completed each achievement received the card when presenting for routine services.",
            "Participants without cellular phones could opt to give them to a family member, sell them for cash, or trade them for other goods.",
            "Both the point-of-care CD4 testing and accelerated ART initiation interventions were provided by health facility staff to all individuals diagnosed with HIV in the VCT clinic regardless of whether they were enrolled in the study, while the SMS messages and FIs were provided by study staff and only to study participants.",
            "Data collection and outcomes",
            "Site assessments",
            "Data on the configuration of HIV services at the 10 participating study sites were collected at the beginning and at the end of the study using a standardized site assessment form.",
            "The purpose of the site assessments was to identify important similarities and differences between participating health facilities, as well as to better understand how services at the site could impact study implementation.",
            "Baseline interview",
            "Participants completed closed-ended questionnaires administered by trained research assistants at the time of study enrollment.",
            "The questionnaire took about 30 minutes to complete, and gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, social and family support, mental health, alcohol use, HIV testing history, HIV knowledge and beliefs, and anticipated stigma and barriers to care.",
            "Anticipated stigma was assessed through 6 items adapted from the 12-item anticipated HIV stigma index developed by Earnshaw and Chaudoir.",
            "Stigma scores were summed, then dichotomized into 2 groups: highest (>75th percentile) versus lower anticipated stigma.",
            "Mental health was assessed via a 7-question evaluation based on the Kessler 10-item scale for psychological distress.",
            "Mental health scores were summed, then dichotomized into 2 groups: highest (<75th percentile) versus lower level of distress.",
            "Perceived availability of social support was assessed with 4 questions adapted from a 9-item scale by Wortman and colleagues.",
            "Social support scores were summed, then dichotomized into 2 groups: higher (>50th percentile) versus lower social support.",
            "Questions assessing HIV-related knowledge and attitudes were based on those used by one of the authors in a previous study.",
            "HIV knowledge scores were summed, then dichotomized into 2 groups: higher (>50th percentile) versus lower knowledge.",
            "Baseline interview data were double-entered into a study database, and a computer program identified discrepant double-entered results for correction against the paper-based forms.",
            "Patient tracing and follow-up interviews",
            "One and 12 months after enrollment, up until June 30, 2016, trained research assistants contacted participants by phone to ascertain their vital status and HIV care status, and to administer follow-up questionnaires.",
            "If the participant could not be contacted by phone after 3 attempts, research assistants visited the participant\u2019s home up to 3 times.",
            "Participants who were located completed closed-ended interviews that gathered updated information on key domains from the baseline questionnaire, as well as self-reported information on linkage to (1- and 12-month questionnaires) and retention in HIV care (12-month questionnaire only), reasons for linkage/non-linkage (1- and 12-month questionnaires) and retention/non-retention (12-month questionnaire only), ART status, hospitalizations, and anticipated stigma.",
            "In cases where the participant could not be located, research assistants contacted a friend or family member as specified by the participant at study enrollment.",
            "Research assistants did not refer to HIV or the health facility during contact tracing but rather attempted to determine whether the participant was alive or dead.",
            "For those whose vital status could not be determined through contact tracing, research assistants searched existing electronic medical records at other primary health facilities supported by the Center for Collaboration in Health in the same district to assess whether patients had enrolled in HIV care at another facility, and reviewed death registers at the municipal and provincial levels to ascertain their vital status.",
            "Similar data entry and reconciliation procedures to those used for the baseline interview data were used for the tracing and follow-up data.",
            "Abstraction of clinical data for patients linking to HIV care at the diagnosing facility",
            "As part of routine clinical practice for HIV patients, clinicians documented patient information at every clinic visit on national HIV care forms, and trained data clerks entered those data into an Access-based electronic medical record.",
            "In its role as a PEPFAR implementing partner supporting the study sites, the Center for Collaboration in Health assessed the completeness and accuracy of these electronic data every 4 months and initiated targeted interventions to enhance data quality if there was greater than 15% disagreement on key data elements between the electronic and paper-based systems.",
            "During the study period, research assistants reviewed the electronic medical records to identify study participants who had linked to care at their diagnosing facility.",
            "For those located, we extracted the complete electronic medical record, capturing information on visit dates, vital status, transfer status, ART status, laboratory test results, and opportunistic infections.",
            "Outcomes",
            "The primary outcome was a combined outcome of linkage to HIV care within 1 month of diagnosis plus retention in care 12 months after diagnosis measured at the individual level.",
            "We used a combined outcome to reflect the fact that improvements are needed across the HIV care continuum in order to maximize individual and population health.",
            "Linkage to care was defined by at least 1 clinical consultation for HIV that included assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and a physical exam.",
            "Retention in care was defined by a clinic visit in the 90 days prior to the end of the 12-month study follow-up period, with no documentation that the patient had transferred to another facility or had died.",
            "We assessed the combined outcome from the perspective of the diagnosing health facility using data from the electronic medical records maintained by the HIV clinics.",
            "All study participants were included in these analyses, including those who did not complete follow-up interviews.",
            "Participants whose electronic medical records were not located were considered not to have achieved the combined outcome for this analysis.",
            "As a secondary approach, we evaluated the combined outcome from the perspective of the Mozambican health program by supplementing data from the electronic medical records with patient reports of linkage to and retention in care at HIV clinics at different health facilities (obtained during follow-up interviews) and information obtained from electronic medical records at other health facilities.",
            "In these analyses, participants whose self-reported linkage and retention status suggested they were linked to and/or retained at a health facility other than their diagnosing clinic were considered to have achieved the respective linkage/retention outcomes.",
            "Participants who either did not complete follow-up interviews or did not self-report linkage to or retention at another clinic maintained their initial outcome designation.",
            "All study participants were included in these analyses.",
            "Secondary outcomes included linkage to care at several predefined time points, ART eligibility assessment (defined as receipt of WHO staging and/or CD4 cell count), ART initiation, disease progression (defined as a new WHO stage 3/4 condition or hospitalization noted in the electronic medical records or self-reported during follow-up interviews), retention in care 6 and 12 months after diagnosis regardless of the timing of linkage, and death.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "The trial was designed and powered to measure outcomes at the individual level, with outcomes assessed within each cluster (5 clusters per arm).",
            "In our initial power calculations, we anticipated that an average of 200 patients per clinic (in the CIS and SOC arms) would be eligible for enrollment based on historical data on the annual number of adults testing positive in the VCT clinics at the participating health facilities.",
            "With 5 facilities per study arm, an average of 200 patients per facility, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, and an alpha of 0.05 and assuming that 35% of participants in the SOC arm would achieve the primary outcome, we estimated that the study would have 80% power to detect as statistically significant 55% of participants in the CIS group achieving the primary outcome, and greater than 80% power to detect as statistically significant 75% of participants in the CIS+ group achieving the primary outcome.",
            "Because enrollment proceeded slower than originally planned, at study midpoint we assessed the implications for power if each health facility enrolled an average of 150 participants rather than 200.",
            "Our calculations revealed minimal change in power with this reduction in the number of participants per health facility.",
            "Calculations were performed using PASS 8.0 software for 2 independent proportions in a cluster randomization study design and a 2-sided Farrington and Manning Likelihood Score Test.",
            "Our power estimations and statistical analyses did not take into account the pair matching prior to randomization but rather followed recommendations from Diehr et al. to break matches in statistical analyses of clustered studies when the number of pairs is between 3 and 9.",
            "An intent-to-treat analysis determined the relative risk (RR) of achieving study outcomes between the CIS and SOC groups, and between the CIS+ and CIS groups.",
            "For analyses of the primary outcome, we used random-intercept multilevel log-Poisson models to account for clustering within health facilities with an empirical variance adjustment for small numbers of sampling units described by Morel et al..",
            "We also assessed whether the primary outcome differed after adjustment for patient-level factors by constructing propensity scores that estimated the probability of inclusion in the CIS, CIS+, and SOC groups by age, sex, region, education, income, employment status, marital status, religion, prior year history of being away from home for more than 1 month, travel time to clinic, tuberculosis status, past hospitalizations, diagnosis history, and whether another family member was known to be living with HIV.",
            "The propensity score was included as a covariate in the multivariable log-Poisson models (adjusted analyses).",
            "In post hoc analyses, we further estimated the likelihood of key subgroups achieving the primary outcome using interaction contrast ratios.",
            "The subgroups assessed included subgroups based on baseline age, sex, region of health facility, employment status, marital status, whether the participant was away from home for more than 1 month in the year prior to study enrollment, travel time to clinic, whether a household member was known to be HIV positive, and dichotomous variables based on scales for self-reported anticipated stigma, HIV knowledge, mental health, and perceived social support as described earlier.",
            "For analyses of secondary outcomes, log-Poisson models were used for dichotomous outcomes, and t tests and 2-way median tests as appropriate for continuous outcomes, adjusting for clustering but not for patient-level differences.",
            "Results",
            "Health facility characteristics",
            "As noted above, 10 primary health facilities participated in the study, 4 in Maputo and 6 in Inhambane.",
            "At study start, the 5 health facilities randomized to the intervention arm reported that they had experienced disruptions of 3 or more days in VCT services in the prior 12 months, while only 1 facility randomized to the SOC arm reported experiencing a similar disruption.",
            "By study end, no facilities\u2014whether in the intervention or SOC arm\u2014had experienced such disruptions.",
            "Throughout the study, only intervention sites conducted point-of-care CD4 testing using Pima machines in the VCT clinic.",
            "Two SOC sites reported that they had Pima machines available in their laboratories but only used them to monitor CD4 counts after patients had enrolled in HIV care.",
            "None of the SOC sites used SMS messaging for health messages or appointment reminders on a routine basis for all patients, but 2 sites sent SMS appointment reminders for patients participating in community ART groups.",
            "Though the 2013 national HIV treatment guidelines stipulate that 1 ART preparatory counseling session is required for ART-eligible patients, all the facilities participating in the study typically conducted 2 to 3 sessions prior to ART initiation, with a slight reduction in the number of sessions observed between study start and end.",
            "Enrollment and participant characteristics",
            "Fig 1 shows the enrollment, exclusion, and flow of the patients by study group.",
            "During the study period, 5,327 adults \u226518 years of age were diagnosed with HIV in the VCT clinics at the 10 study facilities.",
            "A total of 265 of those individuals were not referred to the study staff for further information on the study because they informed the HIV testing counselor that they were not interested in the study, were already receiving HIV services, or were not willing to be referred to the diagnosing health facility.",
            "Among the 5,062 who were referred to the study staff for further information, 3,058 did not meet study eligibility criteria.",
            "The main reasons for exclusion were inability to provide informed consent due to distress following diagnosis (19%), inability to understand Portuguese or Xitsua (12%), and refusal to be referred to the diagnosing health facility for HIV services (10%).",
            "A total of 2,004 adults \u226518 years of age enrolled in the study at the 10 health facilities: 744 (37%) in the CIS group, 493 (25%) in the CIS+ group, and 767 (38%) in the SOC group.",
            "The majority of participants were female (64%), and the median age of participants was 34 years of age, with no meaningful differences observed by study group (Table 1).",
            "More than half of the participants (53%) were living with a partner at the time of diagnosis, and 65% of participants had a primary or lower level of education.",
            "Most participants (74%) were employed, and 43% had a monthly income of less than 1,500 meticais (approximately US$50).",
            "One-quarter (27%) reported that another household member was living with HIV.",
            "While no serious adverse events were reported during the study period, there was 1 unanticipated event of a female participant reporting intimate partner violence.",
            "The Mozambican National Committee for Bioethics for Health and the Columbia University IRB were informed of this event, and the participant asked to remain in the study but to conduct all study interviews at the facility (i.e., no follow-up phone calls).",
            "Intervention effect on linkage to and retention in HIV care at the diagnosing facility",
            "As shown in Table 2, the CIS was associated with statistically significant improvements in the combined outcome of linkage to care within 1 month of diagnosis and retention in care 12 months following diagnosis when compared to the SOC.",
            "Analyses using data from electronic medical records to examine linkage to and retention at the diagnosing health facility showed that 57% of participants in the CIS group achieved the primary outcome versus 35% of those in the SOC group (RRCIS vs SOC = 1.58, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.39).",
            "Post hoc calculation of the ICC for the primary outcome according to the methods of Snijders and Bosker for binary outcome data estimated an ICC of 0.066, similar to but slightly higher than the assumed ICC of 0.05 used in power and sample size estimation.",
            "These results were robust to adjustment for patient-level differences (adjusted RR [aRR]CIS vs SOC = 1.55, 95% CI 1.07\u20132.25).",
            "As shown in Fig 2, the greatest intervention effects were observed among young adults age 18\u201324 years (RRCIS vs SOC = 2.39, 95% CI 1.51\u20133.80, p-value for interaction between age and treatment arm = 0.07), those in Maputo (RRCIS vs SOC = 2.31, 95% CI 1.90\u20132.79, p-value for interaction between region and treatment arm < 0.0001), those who did not report that another household member was living with HIV (RRCIS vs SOC = 1.81: 95% CI 1.52\u20132.16, p-value for interaction between household member with HIV and treatment arm = 0.11), and those reporting high levels of anticipated stigma at enrollment (RRCIS vs SOC = 1.95, 95% CI 1.53\u20132.49, p-value for interaction between stigma and treatment arm = 0.10).",

            "We conducted a cluster-randomized study in Mozambique to examine the effectiveness of a multi-component approach to increase linkage to and retention in HIV care\u20142 critical elements of the HIV care continuum\u2014among adults newly diagnosed with HIV.",
            "The operational model of the CIS that we evaluated addresses known structural, biomedical, and behavioral barriers across the HIV care continuum and was composed of evidence-based, practical, and scalable interventions, including CD4 testing in VCT clinics with immediate turnaround of results, accelerated ART initiation for eligible individuals, and SMS health messages and appointment reminders.",
            "An enhanced version of the CIS additionally included FIs.",
            "In the spirit of implementation science, 2 of the interventions were implemented by existing health facility staff, rather than study staff, providing information on the real-world successes and challenges associated with the CIS that can be extrapolated to a range of settings with similar implementation contexts.",
            "Our study showed that participants receiving the CIS were 1.58 times more likely to link to HIV care at their diagnosing facility within 1 month of diagnosis and be retained in care at that same facility 12 months following diagnosis, representing not only a statistically significant but also a programmatically meaningful improvement.",
            "Particularly impressive gains were observed in timely linkage to care at the diagnosing facility: 89% of CIS participants linked to care on the day of diagnosis, representing a greater than 5-fold improvement compared to the SOC, and nearly universal linkage (96%) was achieved within 1 month of diagnosis.",
            "Notably, the intervention effect was greatest in subpopulations documented to have particularly poor outcomes across the HIV care continuum, including young adults and those with high stigma perceptions.",
            "The intervention also had beneficial effects on other important milestones in the HIV care continuum in the 12 months following diagnosis, including the likelihood of patients having their ART eligibility assessed and initiating ART.",
            "While the intervention significantly increased retention in HIV care at both 6 and 12 months following diagnosis, retention in the CIS group remained concerningly low and far short of what is needed to end the HIV epidemic in Mozambique and other high-burden countries.",
            "We found no additional gain in effectiveness from adding FIs to the CIS.",
            "Prior studies examining the effect of FIs in enhancing outcomes across the HIV care continuum among people living with HIV have shown inconsistent results.",
            "Studies from India, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of the Congo reported reductions in time to ART initiation and improvements in retention with the provision of incentives, while in the United States, randomized trials did not show any effect of FIs on linkage to care or viral load suppression.",
            "While 89% of participants in the current study reported that the type of FI provided and the amount of the FIs (i.e., mobile phone air-time vouchers worth approximately US$5 at 3 points in time) were adequate, it is possible that the FIs were not sufficiently optimized to affect behaviors.",
            "Indeed, as reported elsewhere, patient reactions to the FIs were surprisingly tepid, with only 21% reporting it to be the \u201cmost useful\u201d intervention for retention in care 12 months following diagnosis.",
            "Additionally, fidelity to the FI component of the intervention package was imperfect, with, for example, 86% of participants eligible to receive the first incentive actually receiving it, which may have further limited the effect of this intervention.",
            "However, given the benefits of FIs in other health sectors, further research is needed to understand whether and how they may be optimized to enhance outcomes across the HIV care continuum.",
            "This study has several important strengths.",
            "It is among the first studies to evaluate the impact of a multi-component approach on 2 important HIV care and treatment indicators: timely linkage to care following an HIV diagnosis and sustained retention in care.",
            "Improving performance for these 2 elements of the HIV care continuum is critical for realizing the individual and population benefits of HIV programming in sub-Saharan Africa.",
            "Further, while studies have examined the effectiveness of multi-component intervention packages that include FIs on HIV care outcomes, this study is the first to our knowledge to use a design that permits estimation of the additional benefit of including FIs as part of such a package.",
            "Our study also had limitations.",
            "First, in alignment with recent recommendations for implementation science studies, we used existing electronic medical records in the HIV clinics at the study sites to ascertain outcomes at the diagnosing facility, but such records may have limited data quality.",
            "However, data quality assessments were conducted regularly during the study period and ensured at least 85% concurrence between paper-based and electronic medical records on key data elements.",
            "Second, aside from the FI, we cannot unpack the effect of individual intervention components.",
            "Third, the relevance of point-of-care CD4 count testing may change as countries adopt \u201ctreatment for all\u201d strategies, although our results suggest that providing people living with HIV with additional information on their health status immediately following diagnosis may be important in facilitating same-day linkage to care and likely same-day ART initiation.",
            "Fourth, the CIS+ cohort was enrolled once the target sample size had been reached in the CIS cohort, thus introducing the potential for secular trends to have biased the comparison of the CIS and CIS+ packages.",
            "However, because we found no difference in the primary outcome between the CIS+ and CIS groups, secular trends would have had to have operated in the direction of reducing overall linkage and retention for this bias to result in the failure to observe an additional benefit of FIs for linkage and retention.",
            "While this is plausible, we do not have any evidence that a substantial reduction in overall linkage and retention occurred over the relatively limited time frame of the study.",
            "Finally, while the study was implemented in 2 contrasting settings within Mozambique, study facilities were located primarily in urban and semi-urban areas within the city of Maputo and Inhambane Province, which may limit generalizability.",
            "Indeed, settings with lower education and cell phone coverage than those included in our study may experience greater challenges implementing the SMS health messages and appointment reminders.",
            "Similarly, while we set broad inclusion criteria, we did exclude people who did not understand Portuguese or Xitsua, were planning on leaving the community, or were not willing to receive services at the diagnosing facility, all factors that may have reduced generalizability.",
            "Finally, due to slower-than-expected enrollment, we enrolled fewer participants in the CIS+ group than intended, which decreased our power to detect statistically significant differences in study outcomes between the CIS+ and CIS groups.",
            "However, as the proportion achieving the combined outcome in the 2 groups was extremely similar (CIS 57% versus CIS+ 55%), it is unlikely that the inability to detect significant differences was primarily due to lack of power.",
            "Conclusion",
            "Multi-component intervention strategies have been proposed to address troubling gaps in the HIV care continuum.",
            "To our knowledge, this is amongst the first studies to rigorously evaluate such an approach.",
            "The CIS we examined, comprising 3 evidence-based, practical, and scalable interventions, holds great promise as an approach to make much needed gains in the HIV care continuum in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the critical first step of timely linkage to care following diagnosis.",

            "To examine if oral adjunctive therapy with 5,000IU vitD3 or 2x500 mg PBA or PBA+vitD3 to standard chemotherapy would lead to enhanced recovery in sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients.",
            "Methods",
            "Adult TB patients (n = 288) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Bangladesh.",
            "Primary endpoints included proportions of patients with a negative sputum culture at week 4 and reduction in clinical symptoms at week 8.",
            "Clinical assessments and sputum smear microscopy were performed weekly up to week 4, fortnightly up to week 12 and at week 24; TB culture was performed at week 0, 4 and 8; concentrations of LL-37 in cells, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in plasma and ex vivo bactericidal function of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were determined at week 0, 4, 8, 12 and additionally at week 24 for plasma 25(OH)D3.",

            "At week 4, 71% (46/65) of the patients in the PBA+vitD3-group (p = 0.001) and 61.3% (38/62) in the vitD3-group (p = 0.032) were culture negative compared to 42.2% (27/64) in the placebo-group.",
            "The odds of sputum culture being negative at week 4 was 3.42 times higher in the PBA+vitD3-group (p = 0.001) and 2.2 times higher in vitD3-group (p = 0.032) compared to placebo.",

            "Adjunct therapy with PBA+vitD3 or vitD3 or PBA to standard short-course therapy demonstrated beneficial effects towards clinical recovery and holds potential for host-directed-therapy in the treatment of TB.",
            "Trial Registration",
            "clinicaltrials.gov NCT01580007",
            "Introduction",
            "Tuberculosis (TB) is a global pandemic disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that is responsible for almost 9 million active pulmonary TB cases worldwide and about 1.5 million died from the disease in 2013.",
            "The prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB is high and converge with the pandemics of HIV and diabetes, which generates further problems with a lethal combination of diseases.",
            "Despite this scenario, TB is a preventable and curable disease, although treatment of TB is currently long and requires multiple drugs that often have side effects which may range from mild to severe and may require tailored approach to individual cases.",
            "Development of new anti-TB drug has been very slow and most available drugs were developed more than 40 years ago.",
            "Thus, there is a pressing need for development of new classes of novel drugs or repurposed drugs that can shorten the duration of treatment and combat infection with both susceptible and resistant strains of Mtb.",
            "A series of in vitro studies have demonstrated that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3, induces the gene expression of beta-defensin 2 and human cathelicidin LL-37.",
            "These peptides belong to two classes of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) produced in lung epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils that are able to suppress the growth of Mtb and modulate antimicrobial responses.",
            "Active vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 also induces autophagy in Mtb-infected macrophages/monocytes that can control the infection via an LL-37-dependent mechanism.",
            "Accordingly, several studies have shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk to develop active TB.",
            "Altogether, these findings rekindled the interest of vitamin D as an adjunctive therapy to standard anti-TB treatment.",
            "There is growing evidence that adjunct host-directed therapies, could serve as novel approaches to improve standard TB treatments.",
            "We have earlier shown that treatment with sodium butyrate enhances cathelicidin expression in a colonic epithelia cell line and in vivo in colonic epithelium in a rabbit model of shigellosis, which resulted in rapid clinical recovery and a concomitant decline in bacterial load in stool.",
            "Similarly, we have further shown that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a registered drug used for the treatment of urea cycle disease induces LL-37 expression in a bronchial epithelial cell line and in vivo in the rabbit shigellosis model.",
            "A synergistic effect in the induction of LL-37 has also been demonstrated between PBA and 1,25(OH)2D3.",
            "In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that supplementation with a combination of PBA and vitamin D to healthy adults enhanced LL-37 expression and intracellular killing of Mtb in macrophages ex vivo.",
            "In this clinical trial, we aimed to test our hypothesis that oral adjunct therapy with PBA and/or vitD3 administrated to patients with active pulmonary TB would increase LL-37 expression in macrophages and other immune cells and eventually increase elimination of Mtb from the host.",
            "Thus, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to examine if PBA or vitD3 separately or in combination as adjunct treatment to standard chemotherapy could enhance clinical recovery in newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients.",
            "Primary outcomes of the trial included the proportion of TB patients who became culture negative at week 4 and also assessment of clinical endpoints at week 8.",
            "Secondary outcome measures included time to sputum smear conversion, radiological changes, plasma 25(OH)D3 levels, expression of LL-37 in immune cells and killing of intracellular Mtb by infected MDM.",

            "Inclusion criteria: both males and females (age \u226518 years) with a newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive TB who consented to study enrollment.",
            "Exclusion criteria: pregnancy and lactation, relapse TB, HIV infection, hypercalcaemia, regular intake of vitamin D, known concomitant chronic illness such as diabetes, cardiovascular, hepatic and renal diseases and malignancy.",
            "Patients with suspicion of prolonged drug abuse were also excluded.",
            "Information such as history of contact with active TB cases, duration of illness, BCG vaccination and tuberculin skin test status were recorded.",
            "The study was approved by the Research and Ethical Review Committees at the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).",
            "The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT01580007) in April 2012 whereas patient recruitment started in December 2010.",
            "The reason for not registering the clinical trial before the recruitment of the first patient was that the authors were not aware of journal requirements for prospective registration.",
            "Importantly, the delay in trial registration did not have an impact on the study design or on the analysis or presentation of the results (see attached protocol).",
            "Study design and interventions",
            "The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled 4-arm intervention trial with adjunct therapy with PBA and/or vitD3 for 2 months.",
            "TB patients received directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) of a 4 fixed-dose-combination (4-FDC) drugs for 2 months followed by 2-FDC for the next 4 months.",
            "The 4-FDC consists of Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg + Pyrazinamide 400mg + Ethambutol 275mg/tablet while the 2-FDC consists of Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg/tablet.",
            "The company EM-Partners AB (R\u00e5\u00e5, Sweden) prepared tablets containing the adjunctive study drug (4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) (Tributyrate\u00ae) and identical tablets that contained the placebo (tablet bulking agents or excipient).",
            "Vitamin D3 (vit D3) (Vigantol oil) and placebo (Miglyol oil) were obtained from Merck KGaA in Darmstadt, Germany through Popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Bangladesh.",
            "After enrollment, patients were randomized to the following adjunct treatment arms in a 2x2 factorial design and received oral doses of either: (1) placebo PBA and placebo vitD3 or (2) 500 mg twice daily of PBA and placebo vitD3 or (3) placebo PBA and 5000 IU of vitD3 (Cholecalciferol) once daily or (4) PBA combined with vitD3 (PBA+vitD3).",
            "The dose of PBA was chosen based on a recent study from our group where 500 mg PBA given twice daily to healthy volunteers proved to be the optimal oral dose to induce LL-37 and enhance mycobactericidal activity in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) obtained from treated individuals.",
            "The dose of vitD3 was selected based on our previous findings that a weekly dose of 35,000 IU of vitD3 given for 2\u20133 months to pregnant women in the 3rd trimester was found to be safe and also raised maternal 25(OH)D3 concentrations in serum significantly in most women without any adverse effects.",
            "Moreover, there is evidence that daily doses up to 10,000 IU/day for several months have not lead to adverse effects of changes in serum calcium.",
            "Randomization and blinding",
            "Independent assistants from the Hospital pharmacy of icddr,b prepared the study medication packs (PBA and placebo tablets; with identical appearance, color and taste), and labeled these tablets with a randomization number corresponding to the computer-generated randomization sequence.",
            "Similarly, Popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd. labeled bottles for vitD3 (Vigantol oil and Miglyol placebo oil; with identical appearance, color and taste) with the provided randomization number.",
            "To control and balance for the influence of gender a computer-generated stratified block randomization method was used to randomize participants into four groups that would result in equal sample sizes including 4x72 = 288 patients.",
            "The randomized block procedure was performed as follows: (1) a block size of four was chosen at two levels: male and female, (2) possible balanced combinations with four subjects were calculated as 24 blocks and (3) blocks were randomly chosen to determine the assignment of all 288 participants.",
            "This randomization protocol resulted in 72 participants (36 males and 36 females) in each of the four treatment groups.",
            "Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, study investigators and staff.",
            "Sample size",
            "No published data is available on the culture conversion of drug-sensitive TB patients at week 4 or week 8 in Bangladesh.",
            "Data on smear conversion of Bangladeshi TB patients are available from a publication from 1998 which shows 85% smear conversion at 1 month (4 weeks) following anti-TB treatment.",
            "After 2 months of anti-TB chemotherapy close to 99% patients became sputum smear negative.",
            "Thus, to observe treatment effect of adjunctive therapy on smear conversion in TB patients at 2 months is also not useful.",
            "Using these smear conversion data the sample size becomes impractically large (e.g. 726/arm).",
            "For these reasons, in absence of data for powering the trial according to the primary outcome findings from our preclinical studies and TB scores reported by Wejse et al were used for sample size calculation.",
            "Sample size calculations were made based on: i) preclinical outcome as a surrogate marker for sputum conversion: The mean difference in expression of the rabbit cathelicidin CAP-18 in the gut mucosal tissue of untreated Shigella-infected rabbits and infected rabbits compared to PBA-treated infected rabbits was 6.94 with an expected standard deviation of 3.5.",
            "Allowing for 4 groups and expecting a 30% increase in the expression of human cathelicidin LL-37 in tissues when treated with PBA+vitD3 along with standard anti-TB treatment (from 6.94 to 9.04), at a 5% level of significance and 80% power the sample size would be 62 per group.",
            "Considering a loss to follow-up of 15%, the sample size in each group would be 72 with a total of 288 patients. ii)",
            "A composite clinical score: In a superiority design, with a 50% reduction of clinical scores occurring at 2 month post anti-TB treatment, we assume that 25% reduction will take place after one month.",
            "A sample size of 212 patients (53 in each arm) would provide 80% power to demonstrate that each treatment will result in a 25% reduction of the clinical scores after 4 weeks of adjunct therapy (from 6.5 to 4.88) with expected standard deviation of 2.3 making an allowance for 15% attrition rate at 5% level of significance.",
            "The highest sample size was considered.",
            "For sputum smear conversion, the study may be underpowered.",
            "Outcome measures",

            "Our hypothesis was that oral adjunct therapy with PBA alone or in combination with vitD3 to TB patients would increase the expression of the AMP LL-37, a marker for multiple AMPs, in alveolar macrophages and pulmonary epithelium and eventually accelerate elimination of Mtb bacilli from the respiratory tract.",
            "Adjunct therapy with vitD3 alone or in combination with PBA showed increased sputum culture conversion at week 4 and vitD3 alone at week 8 compared to the placebo group.",
            "Importantly, treatment with PBA, vitD3 or the combination also resulted in reduced clinical symptoms.",
            "In line with an improvement of the primary outcomes, treatment with PBA and vitD3 also resulted in a synergistic increased expression of LL-37 in immune cells that was paralleled with an enhanced intracellular killing of Mtb in macrophages ex vivo (Fig 6).",
            "In similar clinical trials, the primary endpoint is usually culture conversion assessed at several time points after initiation of TB therapy.",
            "Although there are no published data on sputum culture conversion in Bangladesh, the smear conversion rate of Bangladeshi TB patients is estimated as fairly good ranging from 13 to 22 days (K Zaman, personal communication).",
            "Martineau et al have demonstrated that the median time to sputum culture conversion was 36 days in TB patients.",
            "Accordingly, week 4 was selected as the readout time point for culture conversion in this study.",
            "Indeed, significant changes in the other outcome variables were also noted already at week 4 including reduction of TB scores, significantly elevated concentration of plasma 25(OH)D3, LL-37 mRNA, LL-37 peptide in PBMC and lymphocytes in the different intervention groups compared to the placebo.",
            "Significant changes in the same variables were also evident at week 8.",
            "A significant effect of adjunctive therapy with PBA could be demonstrated using a composite TB score including resolution of symptoms.",
            "PBA alone was able to reduce clinical TB symptoms as early as the 2nd week of treatment; the effect persisted until week 12 (Fig 7).",
            "Adding chest x-ray to the TB score further supported a beneficial effect of adjunct PBA treatment from week 8 to 12.",
            "The resolution of clinical symptoms was also reflected by reduced neutrophil counts in the PBA and PBA+vitD3 treatment groups.",
            "In this study, we did not find a decrease in the ratio of lymphocyte and monocyte as shown by Martineaue et al, however, monocyte counts alone declined significantly after adjunct therapy with PBA+vitD3 which is also suggestive of resolution of inflammation.",
            "Importantly, our significant finding on the TB scores should be interpreted with caution since the decline in TB scores was also significant in the placebo group.",
            "It is difficult to show an adjunctive effect of immunotherapy with PBA and vitD3 on top of the highly effective standard DOTS therapy.",
            "However, as our aim was to decrease the time of standard therapy and to reduce side effects, the biological effects of PBA and vitD3 may still be clinically relevant.",
            "The role of 1,25(OH)2D3 as an inducer of LL-37 expression has previously been well-established.",
            "Our in vitro studies have shown that PBA can induce the level of LL-37 mRNA and the production of the LL-37 peptide in both lung epithelial cells and human macrophages.",
            "Importantly, a synergistic effect on LL-37 expression was observed when 1,25(OH)2D3 was combined with PBA as seen ex vivo in the current study.",
            "A recent in vitro study have been shown that, PBA together with vitamin D enhance the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects against Mtb infection in macrophages.",
            "We have also provided evidence that oral supplementation with PBA and vitD3 can induce LL-37 in MDM and lymphocytes in healthy volunteers that was linked to an improved killing of intracellular Mtb by infected macrophages ex vivo.",
            "Here we show that the PBA+vitD3 and the vitD3-groups exhibited a more rapid sputum culture conversion detected already at week 4 compared to the placebo-group.",
            "Furthermore, enhanced bactericidal capacity of MDM was significant in the PBA group.",
            "The MDM was cultured from peripheral mononuclear cells of TB patients which might behave differently compared to tissue-resident macrophages, since circulating monocytes do not always end up replenishing tissue macrophage populations.",
            "Our findings may indicate that there was a synergistic effect between PBA and vitD3 in elimination of bacteria from the lungs in vivo in the early phase of the treatment, where resident macrophages and additional immune cells have a major role.",
            "Altogether, the findings of reduced TB scores, increased LL-37 concentration in MDM and increased MDM-mediated killing of Mtb in the PBA-group, suggest an important role of AMPs, such as LL-37, in the recovery from TB disease.",
            "Remission of clinical TB symptoms is probably through resolution of inflammatory responses as well as mycobacterial clearance from the body.",
            "Besides antimicrobial functions, LL-37 exhibits immune-modulatory activities including both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions.",
            "For example, local effects of LL-37 include influences on cytokine/chemokine production, macrophage development and differentiation toward an inflammatory M1 phenotype and enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages.",
            "In addition, LL-37 can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production by down-regulation of signaling through TLR4 via binding to LPS and/or interrupt function of the TLR4 receptor complex in macrophages and dendritic cells.",
            "Furthermore, LL-37 has been linked to receptor-mediated autophagy.",
            "Our study confirms that there were no safety concerns regarding the daily oral doses of vitD3 and PBA that were given to the study patients.",
            "It is important to note that 91% of the Bangladeshi TB patients demonstrated low vitD3 status and 26\u201348% patients demonstrated hypocalcaemia at baseline.",
            "Treatment with vitD3 increased plasma levels of 25(OH)D3 in both vitD3 and PBA+vitD3 arms.",
            "However, there were no cases of hypercalcaemia, although hypocalcaemia persisted in patients who had low calcium at baseline.",
            "We found that the 2-month dose of vitD3 used in the trial enabled almost 100% patients to attain sufficient vitamin D status (>50 nmol/L).",
            "PBA is an FDA approved drug for urea cycle disorders and a dose up to 10 g/day can be safely used for this purpose, which is about 10 fold higher compared to the dose used in the present trial (1g/day).",
            "There were no adverse events specifically linked to the PBA or vitD3 intervention, the majority of the adverse events was very likely due to standard anti-TB therapy.",
            "The limitations of this study were that negative Mtb culture results were not examined for non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, although these patients received DOTS.",
            "The use of antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) in cell culture media for preventing contamination may have some effect on intracellular growth of Mtb in MDM.",
            "In line with other reports using vitD3 adjunct therapy in the treatment of TB, we also showed that the vitD3 intervention did not have an impact on time to sputum smear conversion.",
            "Importantly, in contrast to our findings, none of these clinical trials showed any impact on sputum culture conversion.",
            "Only, Martineau et al showed significantly hastened sputum culture conversion in a sub-group of patients with polymorphism in TaqI vitamin D receptor genotype with improved responsiveness to supplementation.",
            "The strengths of our study are the convenience of dosing regimen of adjunctive therapy that matched with 2 months\u2019 duration of 4-FDC in the standard treatment regimen of DOTS; the daily dose of vitD3 (5000 IU) for 2 months (total dose 300,000 IU) significantly increased the plasma 25(OH)D3 levels in TB patients that sustained for 6 months.",
            "In most TB trials, a high dose of vitamin D eg. up to 100,000 IU has typically been administrated at 3\u20134 occasions during standard anti-TB treatment, which has not provided any clear evidence of adjunctive treatment efficacy.",
            "Importantly, the dose and/or dosing interval required for antimycobacterial therapy is not known and thus it may be insufficient to give such bolus doses.",
            "It has been proposed that daily dosing could be more beneficial than bolus dosing in the treatment of respiratory diseases.",
            "A dose of 150,000 IU of vitD3 given to Indonesian patients did not result in beneficial effects on TB outcomes.",
            "Two intramuscular doses of 600,000 IU of vitD3 in Pakistani patients resulted in greater weight gain and rapid radiographic clearance of the disease in the intervention group.",
            "However, concentration of vitD3 was not determined after supplementation in either study, thus it was not clear if the clinical improvement was associated with elevated 25(OH)D3 levels.",
            "In a trial in Guinea-Bissau, a total dose of 300,000 IU did not result in higher serum 25(OH)D3 in the intervention group compared to the controls.",
            "Also opposed to our study, the TB patients in two of the other trials were not vitamin D insufficient or deficient at baseline (60 nmol/L), which is probably an important prerequisite to observe a positive clinical effect of vitD3 supplementation.",
            "We assumed that vitamin D has to be administered in a concentrated dose (5000 IU/day) at much earlier and more frequent time points (i.e. daily for 2 months) in order to have an optimal antimycobacterial effect and to significantly shorten the duration of standard anti-TB chemotherapy.",
            "Moreover, PBA was added as an additional adjunct therapeutic compound for enhanced impact.",
            "The therapeutic potential of LL-37 in various infections has been demonstrated by in vitro experiments, but efficient use of elicitors of AMPs in clinical studies is rare.",

            "Tailoring the use of such agents as host-directed or pathogen-directed therapies that can restore clinically relevant immune responses can be a novel approach.",
            "Altogether, the findings of this clinical trial are encouraging; there are indications that this type of host-directed therapy can be exploited to fight respiratory infections by enhancing innate immunity, antimicrobial activity and modulating immune responses.",

Other non-random approaches happen much less frequently than the systematic approaches mentioned above and tend to be obvious. They usually involve judgement or some method of non-random categorization of participants, for example: Allocation by judgement of the clinician; Allocation by preference of the participant; Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; Allocation by availability of the intervention.\n\nunclear risk: Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of \u2018Low risk\u2019 or \u2018High risk\u2019.",

            "Central to the recommended treatment strategy is the use of directly observed treatment to ensure adherence.",
            "Intermittent or incomplete treatment has been associated with adverse outcomes for patients (severe disease and long term disability, low cure rate, disease relapse, or even death) and for public health (prolonged infectiousness and transmissibility and the development of drug resistance).",

            "One review concluded that randomised trials provide no evidence that directly observed treatment improves cure or rates of completion of treatment in low and middle income countries compared with self administered treatment.",
            "Reminder systems and late patient tracers are effective in various settings, although most trials have been conducted in high income countries.",
            "The provision of monetary and other incentives to improve treatment adherence, including the provision of cash payments and food vouchers, has been found to be effective in some settings.",
            "Food incentives are attractive because of the well described link between malnutrition and tuberculosis; malnourished adults are more likely to develop tuberculosis and tuberculosis causes weight loss.",
            "The extent of malnutrition at diagnosis is strongly associated with severity of lung disease, increased relapse rates, and mortality in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis.",
            "Specifically, Khan and colleagues have shown that patients with tuberculosis who are underweight at diagnosis and achieve a weight gain of less than 5% during the intensive phase of treatment are at higher risk of disease relapse during the following two years.",
            "Various nutritional supplements are being used in tuberculosis programmes in many settings and have been advocated by the World Food Program.",
            "Nutritional supplements are popular with patients, but a recent Cochrane review showed unconvincing evidence of a direct benefit of food supplements on a range of clinical outcomes.",

            "In this randomised controlled trial to examine the use of food as an incentive to improve outcome with tuberculosis treatment we found that food incentives led to modestly higher weight gain but did not result in a significant improvement in adherence to treatment or successful completion of treatment.",
            "Substantial improvement in completion of treatment (\u226510%) is unlikely in this setting.",
            "Smaller beneficial (or harmful) effects cannot be excluded.",
            "Our participants adhered well to treatment, and food, though expensive, was readily available at the urban study site during most of the study period.",
            "In other settings\u2014for example, in sub-Saharan Africa where treatment completion rates are generally lower and food insecurity is widespread\u2014the result might be different.",
            "Conflicting evidence of effectiveness in previous trials",
            "The influence of macronutrient or micronutrient supplementation on outcomes of tuberculosis treatment has been inconclusive in the limited number of trials reported to date and has been summarised in a recent Cochrane review and in table 5.",
            "Reported outcome measures have included sputum smear clearance, symptomatic improvement, weight gain during treatment, cure, recurrence of tuberculosis, and death.",
            "Our study provides the most comprehensive report on relevant outcomes to date and reports on adverse events.",
            "Given the potential for benefit of nutritional intervention, further studies on the role of whole food are warranted.",
            "In this study, the only outcome significantly associated with the intervention was weight gain.",
            "Similar findings have been noted in studies in Singapore and in Tanzania but not in others    .",
            "Specifically, patients who were underweight at baseline were significantly more likely to gain more than 5% during the intensive phase of treatment, an important indicator of improved long term treatment outcome.",
            "This suggests that, although a food intervention seems to have little or no effect on treatment adherence and completion rates, this intervention might still be worth considering in patients with tuberculosis who are malnourished at diagnosis.",
            "This represents an important incremental step in knowledge and contributes to policy relevant evidence.",
            "Symptoms improve with tuberculosis treatment, and all but one study have failed to show a significant additional improvement with adjunctive nutrition.",
            "Early sputum clearance contributes to a decreased period of infectiousness and can have a major influence on tuberculosis control.",
            "Our study showed encouraging trends in sputum smear clearance and cure rates in patients with positive sputum smears but was underpowered to examine these outcomes in the subgroup analysis.",
            "The findings from other studies are conflicting for this outcome, with one Mexican and two Indonesian studies showing more rapid or more complete  sputum smear conversion in the intensive phase, a finding that has so far not been replicated elsewhere.",
            "Mortality during tuberculosis treatment is rare in Timor-Leste, and so it is unsurprising that we were unable to show any influence of the intervention on this outcome.",
            "Even in areas with high HIV prevalence, where death is more common, no effect has been found.",
            "Study limitations",
            "For ethical reasons, we were required to differentiate between patients in the control and intervention groups by spacing their attendance at the clinic: control group in the morning and intervention group at lunchtime.",
            "Qualitative data derived from participants in the intervention group suggest that, despite the overwhelming acceptability of the meal, some people expressed shyness about eating at the clinic, while others complained about time inflexibility relating to clinic attendance.",
            "This might have been an unanticipated barrier to effective treatment, counteracting any positive effect of food provision and might explain the lower than expected adherence to treatment in the intensive phase.",
            "A cluster randomised trial, with a much larger sample size, might have been a more appropriate study design.",
            "The conflict in Dili in the later part of the study clearly affected adherence to treatment in a substantial minority of patients.",
            "This led to a lower than expected overall rate of treatment completion.",
            "There was, however, no significant difference in the intervention or control groups during this period, so this is unlikely to have explained the negative result.",
            "The randomised controlled trial design minimises confounding and maximises study validity.",
            "Our study shows that high quality intervention studies can be conducted successfully even in the most challenging setting.",
            "The strict selection of participants, however, might have excluded patients most likely to benefit.",
            "Our findings might have been different if we included, for example, those patients who were admitted to albuergues (hostels) for the intensive phase.",
            "In Dili, albuergues were designed to accommodate patients with certain characteristics, including high risk of non-adherence.",
            "It is also arguable that the true impact of food on treatment outcome and adherence should be measured differently.",
            "We lacked the necessary funding and equipment on site to measure potential immunological or biological parameters.",
            "Additionally, rather than concentrate on individual treatment outcome or adherence, the impact of a food incentive could be measured in the context of management of a tuberculosis programme.",
            "Perhaps the wider influence on the reputation of the clinics might lead to a greater willingness to come for both diagnosis and remain taking treatment.",
            "An expensive intervention",
            "Food provision is an expensive and logistically complex intervention.",
            "In this study, the introduction of food incentives involved building works, storage costs, purchase of equipment and consumables, transport, and salary costs, in addition to the actual food provided.",
            "When the true costs of these items are taken into account, we estimated the intensive phase costs at $2-3 (\u00a31.2-1.8, \u20ac1.3-1.95) a meal, with a similar weekly cost for the food parcels in the continuation phase.",
            "This effectively doubles the cost per patient of tuberculosis treatment.",
            "There would need to be substantially stronger evidence of effectiveness of food to make this a cost effective intervention.",
            "Conclusion",
            "This randomised control trial of food incentive to improve treatment outcome was successfully conducted in Timor-Leste.",
            "In this setting food supplementation did not significantly improve treatment adherence or treatment outcome.",
            "Further studies with a larger sample size and a wider selection of patients in different settings will be required to confirm or refute this finding.",
            "Assessment of the impact of food supplementation as a strategy to improve management of tuberculosis programmes more widely and on the biological and immunological determinants of treatment response is also appropriate.",

            "Tuberculosis remains an important global public health concern",
            "Adequate adherence to treatment is central to tuberculosis control; food incentives are attractive because of the well described link between malnutrition and tuberculosis",

            "To calculate a 20% difference in diarrhea prevalence between each of our intervention and control arms with a power of 80% and a type 1 error of 0.05, we calculated that we would need a sample size of 300 households in each our arms; therefore, our total sample size would need to be 1,200 households.",
            "Eligibility and enrollment.",
            "Between November and December of 2009, the aforementioned neighborhoods were canvassed by the study team in partnership with community leaders and directors to identify children who met our eligibility criteria.",

            "(1) Filter: participants in this study arm received a Sawyer PointONE filter and a 30-L bucket (with lid) as well as weekly lessons by CGVs on the assembly, use (for drinking and cooking), cleaning, and long-term maintenance of the filter.",
            "If damage occurred to a system component during the study, then a replacement was provided.",
            "(2) WASH BCC: weekly WASH messages from CGVs on personal and family hygiene, sanitation, boiling and chlorine-based water treatments (excluding filtration), vitamin A, hygienic food preparation and cleaning, and parasite prevention were provided to this study arm.",
            "(3) Filter and WASH BCC: this study arm covered all equipment training and messaging used in the aforementioned filter and WASH BCC arms of the study.",
            "(4) Control: participants received weekly messages from CGVs on life skills and attitudes, such as household budgeting, value of children, responsibility to care for children, principles in family unity, and basic environmental stewardship.",
            "Given that drawing people into a social network may help behaviors to spread more extensively through that network, it was decided that the control arm should use a care group structure similar to the other intervention arms but not include promotion of water and sanitation behavior.",
            "In addition to the intervention-specific lessons given above, every study participant was taught basic lessons on diarrheal transmission (biological versus cultural beliefs-based), prevention and treatment, prevention of dehydration, and how to feed a sick child.",

            "If a CGV resigned, study staff gathered the group together to select a replacement or asked another caregiver in the care group to take on the CGV leader role.",
            "All CGVs received a 12-session training module by trained study health technicians.",
            "Health technicians taught CGVs how to present the educational modules, which included peer learning sessions, where health promotion materials were presented to other CGVs for practice.",

            "For this analysis, only surveillance visits in May, June, and July of 2010 were included, because not all study households received the intervention in the first surveillance visit in April of 2010.",
            "We also calculated the monthly diarrhea prevalence for each study arm by dividing the number of surveillance visits when diarrhea was reported by the total number of surveillance visits for each study arm.",
            "To determine the diarrhea prevalence ratios for each of the three intervention arms compared with the control group, we used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a Poisson regression to account for clustering within study geographic clusters.",
            "Although we measure diarrhea prevalence over time, we summarized diarrhea for each child over the study period before analysis.",
            "We use GEEs to approximate the prevalence ratios between study arms, which are close but not exactly the same as from the raw data, because GEEs account for the geographic clustering between children.",
            "We do not rely on the estimates of variability from GEEs, because the number of clusters is too small.",
            "Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sums using the exact method were calculated to determine if there were significant differences between the three study intervention arms and the control arms.",
            "GEEs could not be used to determine these P values because of the low variance estimate attributable to the small number of study clusters.",
            "These variance estimates can be too low when the number of geographic clusters is not large, and they are not reliable enough for P values to be calculated.",
            "All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).",
            "Filter usage.",

            "A CONSORT 2010 diagram of study enrollment and participation is provided in Figure 2 (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials).",
            "Of 1,196 households that began the intervention phase of the study, 97 households were lost because of emigration.",
            "In total, 195 households were excluded from the final analysis: 164 households were excluded, because they were missing two or more household visits between May and July of 2010, and 31 households were excluded, because more than one child was enrolled in the household.",
            "Selected pre-intervention baseline KPC characteristics for all households profiled by the respective study arm are presented in Table 1.",
            "Fifty-three percent of households in our intensive KPC survey reported no sanitation option in their home.",
            "Flush toilet connected to a septic tank was reported in 25% of households, pit latrine without a slab was reported in at 13% of households, and pit latrine with a slab was reported in at 9% of households.",
            "There were no significant differences observed across study arms.",
            "Likewise, the location of toilets and latrines ranged from 11% inside or attached to the dwelling and 77% detached from the dwelling but inside the dwelling property to 11% outside of the dwelling property and < 1% indicated as other.",
            "Demographic features of the study participants, such as caregiver and child ages and sex ratios, were similar across control and filter intervention groups, and they are profiled in Table 1.",
            "The loss of 97 (10.7%) participants to emigration in 4 months reflects the transient nature of the study communities.",
            "The reason for the slightly higher loss to follow-up in the filter and BCC arm is unknown.",
            "Diarrheal disease prevalence and stratified diarrhea prevalence ratios are specified in Figure 3  and Table 2 and were based on CGV reported monthly reported data.",
            "The diarrhea prevalence ratio (DPR) effect estimate compared with the control group for the filter arm was 0.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.10\u20130.22) or a mean reduction in diarrheal disease of 85% after controlling for clustering within geographic clusters.",
            "Additionally, the filter and WASH BCC arm DPR effect estimate was 0.22 (95% CI = 0.16\u20130.30) or a 78% mean reduction in diarrheal disease.",
            "The lower mean reductions in diarrhea prevalence were significant for both the filter and filter and WASH BCC study arm households compared with the control arm households; both had identical P values of 0.0286 using the Wilcoxon rank sums with the exact method.",
            "Filter usage.",
            "We defined a filter user as someone who reported using the filter always or almost always in a given intervention month.",
            "Of participant households in the filter arm, 97% reported being filter users, and 90% reported being filter users in the WASH BCC and filter arm.",
            "The reason for the higher filter usage in the filter arm compared with the WASH BCC and filter arm is unknown.",
            "Focus group.",
            "Commonly stated positive feedback regarding the water filter included ease of use, clearer appearance of water, and better taste and smell than their source water.",
            "Many stated that they believed that the filter was more effective and advantageous in purifying water than traditionally boiled or chemically treated methods.",
            "Participants made important design recommendations, such as having a cleaner-looking filter hose, a tethered filter spout cap, and a stronger filter storage hook.",
            "Discussion",
            "This study represents the first cluster-based randomized controlled trial on the use of household-level hollow fiber POU water filters (Sawyer PointONE) in the field.",
            "Results from this factorial design study show statistically significant reductions in diarrheal disease among children less than 5 years of age in filter and filter and WASH BCC study arm households compared with control households.",
            "Although a reduction in diarrhea prevalence was observed in the WASH BCC arm households, differences were not statistically significant.",
            "Likewise, no additional reductions in diarrheal disease were observed in filter and WASH BCC households compared with the households that only had the filter.",
            "Piped treated municipal water delivery is still an important developmental goal for low-income populations.",
            "However, the Sawyer PointONE POU filter seems to be an effective interim tool for use in communities using microbial-contaminated water sources.",
            "Compared with ceramic candle filters (i.e., Katadyn 2110070), the PointONE filter costs less: $216 for the ceramic filter compared with $60 for the PointONE filter.",
            "The PointONE filter also has the added benefit of being easy to transport and install, making it a good option in combating waterborne disease in emergency settings.",
            "In addition, the PointONE filter has a manufacturer-specified 10-year minimum lifespan.",
            "Filter usage has an inherent environmental benefit over boiling water, which places high demand on collecting firewood and in turn, degrades puna, forests, and scrubland habitat, contributing to habitat loss pressures for endemic birds and native plants.",
            "In the present intervention, we did not observe a significant impact of the WASH BCC study arm.",
            "The findings suggest that the distribution of the filter alone was sufficient to reduce diarrhea outcomes.",
            "This finding is consistent with metaregressions by Brown and others, Stauber and others, and Hunter on filter interventions conducted in Asia using ceramic water purifiers (CWPs) and biosand filters (BSFs).",
            "Results from this study suggest that hollow fiber filters can reduce diarrhea prevalence in children under the age of 5 years an additional 6\u201313% compared with 72% reported in a study on CWPs in Bolivia.",
            "Compared with the DPR values reported in a study in Cambodia on CWPs (0.58, 95% CI = 0.41\u20130.82) and iron-rich CWPs (0.65, 95% CI = 0.46\u20130.93), the diarrheal disease prevalence reductions associated with the PointONE filter seem to be noteworthy.",
            "Likewise, in another Cambodian study on BSF interventions, a 22% reduction in prevalence of diarrhea was observed, still markedly lower than the effect sizes reported with the PointONE filter.",
            "Lastly, in a meta-analysis on 33 reports from 21 different countries conducted by Clasen and others, chlorination and flocculation disinfection studies estimating the intervention effect in children under 5 years of age using longitudinal prevalence ratios showed that they were less effective (0.91, 95% CI = 0.82\u20131.02 and 0.42, 95% CI = 0.13\u20131.37, respectively).",
            "Intervention expenses vary depending on the technologies and level of human resources required, and therefore, it is important for healthcare and social work organizations to weigh the costs and benefits of using the filter alone or with educational modules.",
            "There are several limitations to the present study.",
            "One limitation is the short duration of the study intervention period of 3 months.",
            "A future study should be conducted for a longer period of time to assess the sustainability of this filter technology over time.",
            "A second limitation is the small amount of geographic clusters in the present study.",
            "If the number of clusters had been larger, we would have been able to use GEEs to detect significant differences between our study arms and adjust for study covariates, such as sociodemographic characteristics in the study population.",
            "A third study limitation is that the same CGVs that administered the study interventions collected diarrheal surveillance data, which could result in differential reporting bias, potentially leading to underreporting of diarrhea in the intervention versus the control arms.",
            "A fourth study limitation is that we used a 2-week recall on the presence of diarrhea and did not collection information on the number of episodes or the severity or duration of episodes.",
            "It has been established that recall periods beyond 2 days can underreport events.",
            "Because of this tendency, we measured diarrheal disease prevalence conservatively, and therefore, the effect sizes given in this study are likely underestimates.",
            "Lastly, an important design limitation is the lack of study blinding with the implementation of a placebo/sham filter study arm.",
            "Members of the research team and the local administration of Food for the Hungry\u2013Bolivia voiced many logical and ethical reservations to this aspect of the study design.",
            "Therefore, there exists a potential for participant-level reporting bias in the intervention study arms.",
            "Conclusion",
            "The findings from the present study suggest that the Sawyer PointONE filter can be an effective tool to reduce diarrheal prevalence in children under the age of 5 years.",
            "Additional research is needed to evaluate this filter in different settings globally.",
            "A longer longitudinal study would also be helpful in providing a stronger evidential base for the sustainability of the interventions' efficacy.",
            "Also, implementation in diverse environmental settings (such as areas with disparate rainfall regimes) and diverse cultural settings (such as areas with different water, sanitation, and hygiene practices) would be helpful.",
            "Likewise, a comparative rapid assessment of water-borne disease prevalence in disaster relief populations with groups using Sawyer PointONE hollow fiber filters, other POU filters (e.g., ceramic candles), and chemical treatment (e.g., Aquatab and chlorine-based treatments) could be of additional use.",

            "Between August 2007 and May 2010, the Uganda Ministry of Health and the Medicines for Malaria Venture conducted the Consortium for ACT Private Sector Subsidy (CAPSS) pilot study to test whether access to ACT in the private sector could be improved through the provision of a high level supply chain subsidy.",
            "Methods",
            "Four intervention districts were purposefully selected to receive branded subsidized medicines - \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d, while the fifth district acted as the control.",
            "Baseline and evaluation outlet exit surveys and retail audits were conducted at licensed and unlicensed drug outlets in the intervention and control districts.",
            "A survey-adjusted, multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyse the intervention\u2019s impact on: ACT uptake and price; purchase of ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset; ACT availability and displacement of sub-optimal anti-malarial.",
            "Results",
            "At baseline, ACT accounted for less than 1% of anti-malarials purchased from licensed drug shops for children less than five years old.",
            "However, at evaluation, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d accounted for 69% of anti-malarial purchased in the interventions districts.",
            "Purchase of ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset for children under five years rose from 0.8% at baseline to 26.2% (95% CI: 23.2-29.2%) at evaluation in the intervention districts.",
            "In the control district, it rose modestly from 1.8% to 5.6% (95% CI: 4.0-7.3%).",
            "The odds of purchasing ACT within 24 hours in the intervention districts compared to the control was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.08-2.68, p=0.4) at baseline and significant increased to 6.11 (95% CI: 4.32-8.62, p<0.0001) at evaluation.",
            "Children less than five years of age had \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d purchased for them more often than those aged above five years.",
            "There was no evidence of price gouging.",
            "Conclusions",
            "These data demonstrate that a supply-side subsidy and an intensive communications campaign significantly increased the uptake and use of ACT in the private sector in Uganda.",
            "Background",
            "Malaria is a parasitic disease that mostly affects the poorest populations of the world, with sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the heaviest disease burden .",
            "Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is a key component of all national malaria control strategies.",
            "In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) case management guidelines were revised to endorse artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria .",
            "In line with WHO recommendations, Uganda\u2019s anti-malarial treatment policy since 2006 has been ACT, specifically artemether-lumefantrine (AL), as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria .",
            "However, this policy shift faced major implementation challenges.",
            "First, although AL is provided free of charge through the country\u2019s extensive network of public and not-for-profit health facilities; frequent stock-outs have severely limited its actual availability .",
            "Second, ACT is highly priced in private sector outlets and there is poor availability in rural shops.",
            "However, the private sector cannot be ignored, as it is the first port of call for about 60% of Ugandans seeking treatment for fever across all socio-economic groups .",
            "In response to the likelihood of an emerging threat of artemisinin resistance, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a 2004 expert report proposing that the price of ACT, the most effective malaria treatment, would have to be subsidized at the factory-gate to make them as affordable and as available as sub-optimal monotherapies such as chloroquine .",
            "The IOM report hypothesized that this would crowd out ineffective medicines in both the public and private sectors and delay the emergence and spread of parasite resistance to the artemisinin class of drugs.",
            "The IOM proposal evolved into a new initiative aimed at closing the affordability gap - the Affordable Medicines Facility, malaria (AMFm), whose phase 1 is hosted by the Global Fund.",
            "AMFm is designed to provide a subsidy for ACT at the top of the supply chain, as well as to support a core set of interventions to ensure uptake and correct use .",
            "However, the global debate for and against this approach is on-going .",
            "The results of the Independent Evaluation of Phase I of the AMFm will inform the Global Fund Board\u2019s decision in November 2012 on the future of AMFm beyond the phase 1 .",
            "In 2007, the Uganda Ministry of Health (Ug-MoH) and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), in consultation with national and international stakeholders, designed the Consortium for ACT Private Sector Subsidy (CAPSS) pilot study to test the viability of the AMFm approach.",
            "The Ugandan pilot was one of two designed to assess the overall feasibility of providing affordable treatment through the private sector .",
            "The CAPSS pilot study had a number of specific and quantifiable targets including: a) to ensure that the subsidized ACT is continuously available in at least 70% of all licensed private sector outlets - the subsidy was not sanctioned for sale in unlicensed outlets in accordance with Uganda\u2019s policy and regulatory framework; b) to increase by 50% the number of children under five years old who have access to effective treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever; c) to ensure that 85% of people who purchase the ACT comply with the recommended treatment schedules and d) to achieve 40% market share of all anti-malarials purchased at licensed drug shops.",
            "Here the findings from the CAPSS pilot study are reported, that demonstrate that the AMFm strategy is feasible and can improve access to life saving medicines in the private sector in rural Uganda.",
            "Methods",
            "Pilot study design",
            "Four contiguous intervention pilot districts (Kamuli, Kaliro, Pallisa, and Budaka) were selected to receive the subsidized medicines, while the fifth district (Soroti) acted as the control.",
            "To limit leakage of the intervention to the control area, the control and intervention areas had two intervening buffer districts (Bukedea and Kumi) or a lake between them (Figure\u2009 1A).",
            "The pilot districts had a total of 104 public health facilities and over 750 private sector outlets, predominantly drug shops (licensed and unlicensed).",
            "The private sector was also more widely distributed across the districts (Figure\u2009 1B).",
            "All the five districts have perennially high malaria transmission, with estimated parasite prevalence above 60% in school-going children [un-published MMV-Ug-MoH report].",
            "At the time of study initiation, the overall population of the intervention districts was 1.4 million people [Uganda Bureau of Statics, Population Census Projections].",
            "Baseline surveys",
            "Prior to the pilot study, in July 2007, the Ug-MoH and MMV carried out a two-part baseline household survey in order to fully understand the supply and demand for anti-malarials . .The baseline household survey provided a comprehensive picture of malaria treatment, which subsequently shaped the pilot\u2019s design.",
            "One of the baseline household survey\u2019s findings was that access to effective treatment was extremely low.",
            "In 2007, in the most vulnerable age group, of children under the age of five years, only 3% of those contracting a fever received effective treatment (ACT) within 24 hours of symptom onset.",
            "This figure rose to just 4% after 48 hours of symptoms onset .",
            "The baseline household surveys also demonstrated that 60\u201370% of people obtained anti-malarial treatment from private sector drug shops .",
            "The private sector was dominant in part because private outlets are more numerous and widespread and in part because drug shops were better stocked and open for longer hours.",
            "Further, stock-outs of all anti-malarial medicines were very frequent in the public sector facilities .",
            "In addition, the baseline household surveys highlighted price differences that may play a key role in determining which medicines caregivers use to treat malaria.",
            "The price range for a full dose of ACT, in 2007, was Ugandan shillings (UGX) 9,000-20,000 (USD 5.40-12.00), while that for a full course of chloroquine in a drug shop was UGX 200\u2013500 (USD 0.12-0.30) .",
            "The predominant proportion of Ugandans live on less than USD 1.25 a day, suggesting that price matters greatly.",
            "A comprehensive and multi-pronged intervention",
            "The CAPSS Uganda pilot study was designed in line with the AMFm approach of providing subsidized medicines in combination with supporting interventions, including provider training and demand generation.",
            "Several consultative meetings were held in Uganda to design the intervention and build on existing best practices.",
            "The pilot study was approved by all the relevant competent bodies of the Ug-MoH and ethical approval was obtained from the competent research ethics committee.",
            "During the baseline and periodic evaluation conducted through outlet client exit surveys, each respondent provided informed consent before being interviewed.",
            "Pilot study management structure to ensure proper governance",
            "The top most level of the CAPSS pilot study management structure comprised the project management team consisting of representatives from the Ug-MoH, the National Drug Authority-NDA and MMV.",
            "The implementation team, responsible for managing the day-to-day aspects of the pilot study, included representatives from the lead CAPSS partners - Programme for Accessible Health Communication and Education (PACE), Surgipharm Pharmaceuticals, Malaria Consortium-MC, Ug-MoH, NDA, MMV and the district health officers of the pilot districts.",
            "Aligning the intervention to the policy and regulatory framework",
            "Prior to the pilot, AL was regulated as a prescription-only medicine.",
            "In order to facilitate the CAPSS intervention, the Uganda NDA rescheduled AL so that it could be provided over the counter within the intervention area.",
            "Repackaging and branding to ensure the subsidized product stands out",
            "New packaging was designed for the subsidized AL (Coartem\u00ae) to differentiate the subsidized product from the public sector offering.",
            "The packaging was also designed to facilitate the correct use of the product, incorporating illustrated instructions on drug usage.",
            "AL was packaged in four colour-coded packs for four different age bands.",
            "As part of the repackaging exercise the subsidized AL was branded \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d to distinguish it from all other forms of ACT and anti-malarials (Figure\u2009 2).",
            "The distinctive branding of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d provided consumers with the instant recognition that they were purchasing a high quality and effective anti-malarial at an affordable price.",
            "Communications programme to take the message to caregivers",
            "A communications campaign rooted in the caregivers\u2019 knowledge, understanding and perception of the recommended health behaviours was instituted.",
            "The campaign was comprehensive, including: community mobilization, community events, radio spots and talk shows, posters, point of sales advertising, songs and community launch events, and was supported by high level ministry of health and district officials.",
            "The wide array of communication activities generated significant brand awareness within a short time.",
            "Supply chain management to get the subsidized product on the shelf",
            "The quantification of the amount of Coartem required for the pilot study was based on estimates of the number of fever episodes per age group using available epidemiological data, the likely source of treatment based on the findings from the household survey, and a buffer for leakage.",
            "A third party was responsible for the importation of the ACT and its storage, as well as for overseeing the repackaging, and the distribution of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d to licensed outlets within the intervention districts.",
            "In line with the AMFm design, the CAPSS pilot sought to replicate the existing supply chain.",
            "However, recognizing that all the intervention districts are very rural and lack a wholesaler within their boundaries, the pilot improved the distribution chain by ensuring that licensed drugs shops directly received their supplies of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d from the distributor or sub-distributor.",
            "Two different compensation models to cover the additional costs of direct distribution were tested.",
            "The costs of weekly distribution to outlets in Pallisa and Budaka were covered directly by MMV, whereas those for Kamuli and Kaliro came out of the distributor\u2019s margins.",
            "Pricing to ensure affordability",

            "To minimize data correlation (i.e. information on multiple febrile patients), one observation per respondent was randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis.",
            "Because the intervention was administered at the district level, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed despite the fact that unlicensed outlets in the intervention districts were not offered the subsidized ACT.",

            "If inclusion of a covariate in the multivariate logistic regression model produced a delta of >10% between the adjusted and unadjusted ORs for the primary exposure, it was deemed a confounder and kept in the model unless subsequent tests for heterogeneity produced sufficient evidence (p<0.05) that it was an effect modifier in which case the degree of interaction was explored.",

            "The most common reason cited for choosing the outlet at which the respondent was interviewed was proximity (32%; 95% CI: 30.3-34.0%), followed by receiving a recommendation or referral (18%; 95% CI: 16.7-19.2%).",
            "Post survey-adjustment, it was found that 26.2% (95% CI: 23.2-29.2%) of respondents in the intervention districts purchased ACT compared to 5.6% (95% CI: 4.0-7.3%) in the control district.",

            "Encouragingly, ACT purchasers exhibited three times the odds of citing \u201cdrug price\u201d as the primary reason for purchasing their medicine relative to non-ACT purchasers (6% vs. 2.5%; p<0.001).",
            "Further, the proportion of ACT purchasers indicating that they felt the medicine they purchased was affordable or very affordable was 61% (95% CI: 56.8-64.3%) and 25% (95% CI: 20.9-28.7%), respectively.",
            "In contrast, the proportion of non-ACT users saying the same was 35% (95% CI: 33.0-37.4%) and 8% (95% CI: 6.6-9.1%).",

            "ACT with a leaf uptake in the intervention districts",
            "By the end of the pilot study, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d accounted for 69% of all anti-malarials purchased at licensed drug shops to treat malaria in the under-five year old age group in the four intervention districts (Figure\u2009 4).",
            "In line with national regulations, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d was not sold to unlicensed drug shops; however, the product leaked to some outlets, resulting in 14% of the caregivers of children visiting unlicensed outlets receiving \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d.",
            "The share of subsidized ACT among all anti-malarials purchased dropped in September 2009 as demand outstripped supplies, resulting in stock-outs.",
            "This was itself largely due to the knock-on effect of protracted public sector ACT stock-outs, resulting in virtually all access to ACT in the intervention areas being through the private sector.",
            "This also increased the share of quinine sales from licensed drug shops and chloroquine sales in unlicensed outlets.",
            "Low price made \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d the medicine of choice",
            "The subsidy brought the price of ACT in line with that of chloroquine and a full course of a child\u2019s treatment was lower than that for quinine (Figure\u2009 5A).",
            "The subsidy along with a good communication campiaign was highly successful in ensuring that the maximum recommended retail price (MRRP per tablet: UGX 33) was respected, particularly in licensed outlets, with the mean price varying within a 10 percent band (Figure\u2009 5B).",
            "Most children received the right dose",
            "Over 80% of caregivers of children under five (except in Pallisa) purchased the correct number of tablets at the right price.",
            "Knowledge of the correct dosing varied: about 70% of caregivers knew the correct number of tablets per dose and over 80% knew that the dose should be given twice a day for three days.",
            "The level of knowledge in Budaka was higher than the other districts.",
            "The composite indicator across all intervention districts for the appropriateness of the treatment administered was 71%, with the lowest score of 65% in Pallisa and the highest of 89% in Budaka (Figure\u2009 6).",
            "Discussion",
            "The CAPSS pilot study was successful in demonstrating that a subsidized product coupled with an intensive communication campaign leads to increased purchase and use of ACT in the private sector.",
            "There was a six-fold increase in the number of people (all age groups) and a ten-fold increase in children under five years old purchasing effective malaria treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever.",
            "Further, over 70% of the caregivers who purchased an ACT complied with recommended treatment schedules.",
            "All the objectives set at the outset were thus achieved.",
            "The CAPSS pilot study validates the hypothesis that affordable treatment drives availability and uptake, thereby displacing ineffective treatments, and provides evidence to support the AMFm concept.",
            "The preliminary findings from the CAPSS pilot study were shared with the AMFm task force in 2010 and provided the rationale for using the universal logo for all AMFm products  - the CAPSS logo of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d was chosen as the AMFm product logo (\u201cACTm with a leaf\u201d).",
            "We believe the effect sizes we observed between the intervention and control areas are statistically modest compared to what could have reasonably been expected.",
            "There are two reasons for this.",
            "First, the overall ACT availability in public health facilities in the control district (Soroti) improved greatly, with three-quarters of facilities having ACT in stock in May 2010 [Uganda HMIS reports].",
            "The contextual information suggests that there was better availability of ACT in the public sector in the control district because of improvements that had been made in the procurement and distribution system, based on a push instead of a pull system for the lower-level health units.",
            "However, this was not the case in the intervention districts.",
            "Consequently, slightly more than half of the public health facilities in Pallisa and Kaliro had no public sector ACT packs in stock at the time of the surveys; and the situation in Budaka was distressingly inadequate, with three quarters of public sector facilities having no ACT in stock.",
            "Second, the intervention made by another group (Living Goods) to improve access to ACT at community level in the control district had an impact on ACT supply there.",
            "These findings make us believe that the effect differences could have been bigger had these developments not taken place or had the public sector supply chain not failed in the intervention districts.",
            "The private sector\u2019s role in ensuring access to medicines is largely complementary to that of the public sector: the nature of this role is determined primarily by the level of availability in public sector outlets.",
            "When there are stock-outs in the public sector, the private sector\u2019s role inevitably shifts from a complementary one to primary.",
            "Whether the private sector played a complementary or primary role therefore varied greatly during the different rounds of data collection.",
            "For example, in Kaliro, Pallisa and Budaka, access to ACT was largely assured through the availability of the subsidized ACT in the private sector, because stock-outs in the public sector were very frequent.",
            "However, in Kamuli, private sector availability complemented existing public sector availability.",
            "ACT access through the private sector was very low in the control district.",
            "Based on these findings, we believe that moving forward; the AMFm strategy should be tailored to the local context .",
            "There are settings where strengthening the public sector can achieve substantial improvements in access to malaria treatment.",
            "However, in settings like Uganda, strengthening the public sector without providing complementary support from the private sector is very unlikely to achieve the WHO Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP) case management access target that 80% of patients should receive treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset .",
            "While the CAPPS pilot study was very successful, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure adequate availability in poor and remote rural areas.",
            "This requires a number of specific actions, such as incentivising suppliers to deliver medicines to such areas, or strengthening community based systems, such as that of Uganda\u2019s village health teams.",
            "Ensuring there are sufficient licensed outlets to meet demand is also critical.",
            "In the more developed areas of Uganda, where private businesses flourish, a sufficiently large number of private outlets are able to achieve the required licensing standards.",
            "However, in other less developed areas, where there are currently few or no private licensed outlets, there is insufficient coverage.",
            "In addition, the outlets that do exist in these areas are often severely constrained, since many of the smaller outlets rely on the immediate cash flow from sales to pay for their next orders.",
            "These cash flow constraints result in the smaller outlets placing very small orders with the distributors, since they cannot afford to tie up significant amounts of money in stock.",
            "Prices in the more remote rural areas are often even higher than in urban/suburban centres, largely due to the additional costs of distribution.",
            "Enhancing access to ACTs in poorer, more remote areas requires overcoming these distribution challenges.",
            "A second challenge is the difficulty of maintaining the maximum recommended retail price in the face of currency exchange fluctuations.",
            "The Ugandan Shilling faced ongoing devaluation during the course of this study.",
            "This resulted in the importers of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d facing higher landed costs, costs which are normally passed on to the consumers in terms of higher prices.",
            "Moreover, national drug regulatory agencies in many countries, particularly in East Africa, do not attempt to control market prices in view of price liberalization policies.",
            "Rather than imposing a maximum price, therefore, a more pragmatic approach might be to issue a \u201crecommended retail price range\u201d (RRPR).",
            "This would be effective in setting price expectations.",
            "The maintenance of the ACT price is also subject to the availability of the continuing subsidy; this price is consequently vulnerable to changes in the global funding landscape.",
            "A third challenge, applying to both the public and private sectors, is the need to avoid stock-outs.",
            "Ensuring uninterrupted availability of ACT is critical to guaranteeing access to effective treatment.",
            "In this regard, the two sectors can work synergistically to improve access to treatment.",
            "A concerted effort needs to be made to ensure that more caregivers of children under five seek treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever and have access to ACT.",
            "The introduction of rapid diagnostic tests in the public sector and subsequently in the private sector could help ensure targeting of ACT.",
            "Such an approach would ensure that patients quickly get access to the correct treatment for malaria based on parasite-based diagnosis as per current WHO recommendations .",
            "The results of the independent evaluation of the AMFm from Uganda validate the CAPSS findings of affordability driving stocking and uptake as availability of quality assured ACTs (AQ-ACT) across all outlets increased from 21% at baseline to 67% at endline .",
            "The recommended retail price (RRP) however of USD 0.47 for an adult course of treatment was not adhered to; the median price at the endline survey was USD 1.96.",
            "The independent evaluation suggests that this may be influenced by the absence of supporting interventions before the final round of data collection due to delays in the disbursement of the Global Fund grant and the fact that only 10% of respondents knew that there was a RRP and only 5% knew the level.",
            "Certain limitations in the design of this study need to be noted.",
            "First, the districts were purposefully selected and only one district was used as a control.",
            "This could have increased the potential for discordance between the populations included in the study.",
            "Some discordance was observed between the intervention and control districts at baseline in terms of drug consumption habits.",
            "Fortunately, the observed disparities did not include the use of ACT.",
            "Generating survey-adjusted outputs was intended to provide a more reasonable range of likely values that accounted for this prior to executing tests of significance.",
            "Second, only respondents leaving drug outlets at specific times and who consented to the interview were analysed.",
            "This could lead to both a selection and response bias.",
            "Different groups are likely to visit drug stores at different times during the day.",
            "As an example, people who are employed full-time may be more likely to visit an outlet at night.",
            "Also, we did not collect detailed information about potential respondents who refused to be interviewed.",
            "It is possible that their characteristics differed from the study sample.",
            "However, the rate of refusal was generally small (not exceeding 10%) and any effect due to refusal probably did not impact significantly on the outcome measures.",
            "Further, the wide range of times at which interviews were conducted, in combination with survey-adjustment, minimized the influence of these possible biases.",
            "Finally, a possible observer bias could arise from the fact that the interviewers were not blinded to the intervention status of the respondents.",
            "To mitigate this risk, a week long training session was administered prior to each round of data collection to instil strict processes for conducting interviews and to prevent - to the extent possible - deviation from the script.",
            "It is unlikely that this lack of blinding could influence the primary outcome in this study, as it was obligatory for the interviewer to observe and record the details of the actual medicine purchased.",
            "Conclusion",
            "These findings provide evidence that a subsidy high up in the supply chain coupled with an intensive communication campaign leads to increased ACT uptake, making a compelling case for AMFm in Uganda and potentially other African settings with similar private sector use.",
            "The approach will need to be customized by country to respond to specific national access challenges.",
            "The approach adopted has been effective in extending uptake in the most vulnerable category, the youngest segment of the population.",
            "Further, it is reassuring that customers purchase the right dose, consistent with observations reported elsewhere in Uganda .",
            "All of the CAPSS pilot study\u2019s multiple data platforms \u2013 the cross-sectional outlet exit surveys with observation and verification of medicines and audits of all retail outlets and public health facilities - confirm that the subsidy of ACT increases access through the private sector to these life-saving medicines.",

            "Between August 2007 and May 2010, the Uganda Ministry of Health and the Medicines for Malaria Venture conducted the Consortium for ACT Private Sector Subsidy (CAPSS) pilot study to test whether access to ACT in the private sector could be improved through the provision of a high level supply chain subsidy.",
            "Methods",
            "Four intervention districts were purposefully selected to receive branded subsidized medicines - \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d, while the fifth district acted as the control.",
            "Baseline and evaluation outlet exit surveys and retail audits were conducted at licensed and unlicensed drug outlets in the intervention and control districts.",
            "A survey-adjusted, multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyse the intervention\u2019s impact on: ACT uptake and price; purchase of ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset; ACT availability and displacement of sub-optimal anti-malarial.",
            "Results",
            "At baseline, ACT accounted for less than 1% of anti-malarials purchased from licensed drug shops for children less than five years old.",
            "However, at evaluation, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d accounted for 69% of anti-malarial purchased in the interventions districts.",
            "Purchase of ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset for children under five years rose from 0.8% at baseline to 26.2% (95% CI: 23.2-29.2%) at evaluation in the intervention districts.",

            "The odds of purchasing ACT within 24 hours in the intervention districts compared to the control was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.08-2.68, p=0.4) at baseline and significant increased to 6.11 (95% CI: 4.32-8.62, p<0.0001) at evaluation.",

            "These data demonstrate that a supply-side subsidy and an intensive communications campaign significantly increased the uptake and use of ACT in the private sector in Uganda.",
            "Background",
            "Malaria is a parasitic disease that mostly affects the poorest populations of the world, with sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the heaviest disease burden .",
            "Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is a key component of all national malaria control strategies.",
            "In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) case management guidelines were revised to endorse artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria .",
            "In line with WHO recommendations, Uganda\u2019s anti-malarial treatment policy since 2006 has been ACT, specifically artemether-lumefantrine (AL), as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria .",
            "However, this policy shift faced major implementation challenges.",
            "First, although AL is provided free of charge through the country\u2019s extensive network of public and not-for-profit health facilities; frequent stock-outs have severely limited its actual availability .",
            "Second, ACT is highly priced in private sector outlets and there is poor availability in rural shops.",
            "However, the private sector cannot be ignored, as it is the first port of call for about 60% of Ugandans seeking treatment for fever across all socio-economic groups .",
            "In response to the likelihood of an emerging threat of artemisinin resistance, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a 2004 expert report proposing that the price of ACT, the most effective malaria treatment, would have to be subsidized at the factory-gate to make them as affordable and as available as sub-optimal monotherapies such as chloroquine .",
            "The IOM report hypothesized that this would crowd out ineffective medicines in both the public and private sectors and delay the emergence and spread of parasite resistance to the artemisinin class of drugs.",
            "The IOM proposal evolved into a new initiative aimed at closing the affordability gap - the Affordable Medicines Facility, malaria (AMFm), whose phase 1 is hosted by the Global Fund.",
            "AMFm is designed to provide a subsidy for ACT at the top of the supply chain, as well as to support a core set of interventions to ensure uptake and correct use .",
            "However, the global debate for and against this approach is on-going .",
            "The results of the Independent Evaluation of Phase I of the AMFm will inform the Global Fund Board\u2019s decision in November 2012 on the future of AMFm beyond the phase 1 .",
            "In 2007, the Uganda Ministry of Health (Ug-MoH) and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), in consultation with national and international stakeholders, designed the Consortium for ACT Private Sector Subsidy (CAPSS) pilot study to test the viability of the AMFm approach.",
            "The Ugandan pilot was one of two designed to assess the overall feasibility of providing affordable treatment through the private sector .",
            "The CAPSS pilot study had a number of specific and quantifiable targets including: a) to ensure that the subsidized ACT is continuously available in at least 70% of all licensed private sector outlets - the subsidy was not sanctioned for sale in unlicensed outlets in accordance with Uganda\u2019s policy and regulatory framework; b) to increase by 50% the number of children under five years old who have access to effective treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever; c) to ensure that 85% of people who purchase the ACT comply with the recommended treatment schedules and d) to achieve 40% market share of all anti-malarials purchased at licensed drug shops.",
            "Here the findings from the CAPSS pilot study are reported, that demonstrate that the AMFm strategy is feasible and can improve access to life saving medicines in the private sector in rural Uganda.",
            "Methods",
            "Pilot study design",
            "Four contiguous intervention pilot districts (Kamuli, Kaliro, Pallisa, and Budaka) were selected to receive the subsidized medicines, while the fifth district (Soroti) acted as the control.",
            "To limit leakage of the intervention to the control area, the control and intervention areas had two intervening buffer districts (Bukedea and Kumi) or a lake between them (Figure\u2009 1A).",
            "The pilot districts had a total of 104 public health facilities and over 750 private sector outlets, predominantly drug shops (licensed and unlicensed).",
            "The private sector was also more widely distributed across the districts (Figure\u2009 1B).",
            "All the five districts have perennially high malaria transmission, with estimated parasite prevalence above 60% in school-going children [un-published MMV-Ug-MoH report].",
            "At the time of study initiation, the overall population of the intervention districts was 1.4 million people [Uganda Bureau of Statics, Population Census Projections].",
            "Baseline surveys",
            "Prior to the pilot study, in July 2007, the Ug-MoH and MMV carried out a two-part baseline household survey in order to fully understand the supply and demand for anti-malarials . .The baseline household survey provided a comprehensive picture of malaria treatment, which subsequently shaped the pilot\u2019s design.",
            "One of the baseline household survey\u2019s findings was that access to effective treatment was extremely low.",
            "In 2007, in the most vulnerable age group, of children under the age of five years, only 3% of those contracting a fever received effective treatment (ACT) within 24 hours of symptom onset.",
            "This figure rose to just 4% after 48 hours of symptoms onset .",
            "The baseline household surveys also demonstrated that 60\u201370% of people obtained anti-malarial treatment from private sector drug shops .",
            "The private sector was dominant in part because private outlets are more numerous and widespread and in part because drug shops were better stocked and open for longer hours.",
            "Further, stock-outs of all anti-malarial medicines were very frequent in the public sector facilities .",
            "In addition, the baseline household surveys highlighted price differences that may play a key role in determining which medicines caregivers use to treat malaria.",
            "The price range for a full dose of ACT, in 2007, was Ugandan shillings (UGX) 9,000-20,000 (USD 5.40-12.00), while that for a full course of chloroquine in a drug shop was UGX 200\u2013500 (USD 0.12-0.30) .",
            "The predominant proportion of Ugandans live on less than USD 1.25 a day, suggesting that price matters greatly.",
            "A comprehensive and multi-pronged intervention",
            "The CAPSS Uganda pilot study was designed in line with the AMFm approach of providing subsidized medicines in combination with supporting interventions, including provider training and demand generation.",
            "Several consultative meetings were held in Uganda to design the intervention and build on existing best practices.",
            "The pilot study was approved by all the relevant competent bodies of the Ug-MoH and ethical approval was obtained from the competent research ethics committee.",
            "During the baseline and periodic evaluation conducted through outlet client exit surveys, each respondent provided informed consent before being interviewed.",
            "Pilot study management structure to ensure proper governance",
            "The top most level of the CAPSS pilot study management structure comprised the project management team consisting of representatives from the Ug-MoH, the National Drug Authority-NDA and MMV.",
            "The implementation team, responsible for managing the day-to-day aspects of the pilot study, included representatives from the lead CAPSS partners - Programme for Accessible Health Communication and Education (PACE), Surgipharm Pharmaceuticals, Malaria Consortium-MC, Ug-MoH, NDA, MMV and the district health officers of the pilot districts.",
            "Aligning the intervention to the policy and regulatory framework",
            "Prior to the pilot, AL was regulated as a prescription-only medicine.",
            "In order to facilitate the CAPSS intervention, the Uganda NDA rescheduled AL so that it could be provided over the counter within the intervention area.",
            "Repackaging and branding to ensure the subsidized product stands out",
            "New packaging was designed for the subsidized AL (Coartem\u00ae) to differentiate the subsidized product from the public sector offering.",
            "The packaging was also designed to facilitate the correct use of the product, incorporating illustrated instructions on drug usage.",
            "AL was packaged in four colour-coded packs for four different age bands.",
            "As part of the repackaging exercise the subsidized AL was branded \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d to distinguish it from all other forms of ACT and anti-malarials (Figure\u2009 2).",
            "The distinctive branding of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d provided consumers with the instant recognition that they were purchasing a high quality and effective anti-malarial at an affordable price.",
            "Communications programme to take the message to caregivers",
            "A communications campaign rooted in the caregivers\u2019 knowledge, understanding and perception of the recommended health behaviours was instituted.",
            "The campaign was comprehensive, including: community mobilization, community events, radio spots and talk shows, posters, point of sales advertising, songs and community launch events, and was supported by high level ministry of health and district officials.",
            "The wide array of communication activities generated significant brand awareness within a short time.",
            "Supply chain management to get the subsidized product on the shelf",
            "The quantification of the amount of Coartem required for the pilot study was based on estimates of the number of fever episodes per age group using available epidemiological data, the likely source of treatment based on the findings from the household survey, and a buffer for leakage.",
            "A third party was responsible for the importation of the ACT and its storage, as well as for overseeing the repackaging, and the distribution of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d to licensed outlets within the intervention districts.",
            "In line with the AMFm design, the CAPSS pilot sought to replicate the existing supply chain.",
            "However, recognizing that all the intervention districts are very rural and lack a wholesaler within their boundaries, the pilot improved the distribution chain by ensuring that licensed drugs shops directly received their supplies of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d from the distributor or sub-distributor.",
            "Two different compensation models to cover the additional costs of direct distribution were tested.",
            "The costs of weekly distribution to outlets in Pallisa and Budaka were covered directly by MMV, whereas those for Kamuli and Kaliro came out of the distributor\u2019s margins.",
            "Pricing to ensure affordability",
            "In line with the AMFm concept, MMV subsidized AL by 95%.",
            "The import prices for the subsidized product for each weight band, corresponding to the four different coloured age packs, was USD 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, respectively.",
            "The final price was calculated in relation to the market prices for other anti-malarials, taking into consideration standard commercial margins.",
            "A maximum recommended retail price (MRRP) for each age pack was printed on the product and the study ensured that the price per tablet in each pack was identical, thereby removing any potential commercial interest in cutting up the packs.",
            "The final MRRP per age pack ranged from UGX 200 to UGX 800 (USD 0.10 to USD 0.40).",
            "Training to ensure drug shop attendants have the requisite knowledge",
            "The training of drug shop attendants was done to ensure the correct dispensing and use of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d.",
            "Prior to the launch of the pilot study, at least two drug shop attendants from each licensed outlet participated in comprehensive training.",
            "This covered malaria case management and product-specific knowledge, including safety monitoring and supply logistics.",
            "Refresher training sessions were also provided during the regular drug distribution circuits.",
            "Monitoring to keep track of impact",
            "In September 2008, a baseline client exit survey (n=1162) was administered to clients exiting all the private drug shops/private clinics/pharmacies (hereafter referred to as \u201coutlets\u201d) in the study districts.",
            "These surveys were conducted by trained interviewers from the research organization - Synovate Kenya and Uganda.",
            "The interviewers were instructed to reach every outlet in all the study districts during a period of approximately two weeks and to administer interviews to exiting clients who were purchasing any medicine(s) for the treatment of febrile illness.",
            "Following the baseline survey, CAPSS initiated the ACT subsidy for the intervention districts and four subsequent rounds of monitoring of cross-sectional surveys were administered in the same manner as the baseline survey, with the final round occurring during the period 20 April - 11 May, 2010 (Baseline: n=1,162; round 1: n=1044; round 2: n=1794; round 3: n=1976 and final round 4: n=5181).",
            "A minimum number of 5 interviews per outlet were respected in the final survey round, resulting in a significantly higher sample size.",
            "For this paper, the baseline and final evaluation survey data were the primary focus.",
            "However, some analysis has been included for the other survey rounds to provide a comprehensive picture.",
            "During each survey round, we also tracked stocking and purchasing behaviour of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d other ACT and other anti-malarials at outlets and stocking of all anti-malarials at public health facilities.",
            "Data management and analysis",

            "Based on the data-collection methods, a survey-adjusted logistic regression model was used.",
            "The outlets were treated as the population sampling units within five strata - the five pilot districts.",
            "As the sampling method was a best attempt at an outlet census, no weighting was applied.",
            "To minimize data correlation (i.e. information on multiple febrile patients), one observation per respondent was randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis.",
            "Because the intervention was administered at the district level, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed despite the fact that unlicensed outlets in the intervention districts were not offered the subsidized ACT.",
            "Univariate, survey-adjusted logistic regression models were constructed to examine the intervention effect sizes.",
            "Finally, the remaining covariates were each treated as the outcome in a univariate, survey-adjusted logistic regression model with intervention status as the exposure variable.",
            "In the step-wise, multivariate logistic regression, covariates were included in descending order of the strength of evidence supporting their association with intervention status - smallest to largest Wald Test p-value.",
            "For covariates with indiscernibly small p-values, the variables possessing the most dramatic odds ratios (ORs) between categories were prioritized for inclusion in the multivariate model.",
            "Additionally, all variables for which the p-value of the association with the intervention status was \u22650.5 were excluded as potential confounders.",
            "If inclusion of a covariate in the multivariate logistic regression model produced a delta of >10% between the adjusted and unadjusted ORs for the primary exposure, it was deemed a confounder and kept in the model unless subsequent tests for heterogeneity produced sufficient evidence (p<0.05) that it was an effect modifier in which case the degree of interaction was explored.",
            "Once all identified confounders were included in the model, a separate model was fitted with an interaction term between intervention status and each variable with a plausible, independent correlation with either the ACT uptake or intervention status.",
            "Adjusted Wald tests of these interaction parameters were conducted to determine whether any variables interacted with the effect of intervention status on ACT uptake, with a significance cut-off of p<0.05.",
            "If evidence of multiple effect modifiers emerged from these tests, the stratum-specific ORs for each interacting variable were presented separately.",
            "Due to the length of the survey and the large number of respondents, missing values were inevitable.",
            "In the event that a variable included in a survey-adjusted model had missing values, listwise deletion of such observations was performed.",
            "Further, in the event that a category within a given variable possessed so few affirmative responses to the extent that it perfectly predicted outcome success or failure, such observations were likewise excluded.",

            "The most common reason cited for choosing the outlet at which the respondent was interviewed was proximity (32%; 95% CI: 30.3-34.0%), followed by receiving a recommendation or referral (18%; 95% CI: 16.7-19.2%).",
            "Post survey-adjustment, it was found that 26.2% (95% CI: 23.2-29.2%) of respondents in the intervention districts purchased ACT compared to 5.6% (95% CI: 4.0-7.3%) in the control district.",
            "The survey-adjusted, univariate logistic model indicated that patients in the intervention districts had a six-fold increase in ACT use relative to the control district (95% CI: 4.22-8.44, adjusted Wald test p<0.001) (Table\u2009 2).",

            "However, tests for heterogeneity indicated evidence of effect modification by two variables, separately: \u201cage of the patient\u201d (p=0.02) and \u201chighest school level completed by the respondent\u201d (p=0.003).",
            "There was only weak evidence (p=0.08) of a three-way interaction between these variables and intervention status (Table\u2009 3).",
            "The observed ORs suggest that the effect of intervention status on ACT uptake diminishes with patient age.",
            "The stratum specific ORs also indicate that the effect of intervention status on ACT uptake tends to be more pronounced among those with lower education than among the better educated (Table\u2009 3).",
            "Improved access to treatment",
            "There was higher access to treatment within 24 hours of fever onset in the intervention districts compared to the control district.",
            "At baseline, only 0.8% of respondents purchased an ACT within 24 hours of fever onset in the intervention districts.",
            "This figure rose to 26.2% in final survey round.",
            "In contrast, the equivalent figure in the control district rose from 1.8% at baseline and to a modest 5.5% at the final survey round (Figure\u2009 3).",
            "The odds of purchasing treatment within 24 hours in the intervention compared to the control districts at baseline were 0.46 (95% CI: 0.08-2.68, p=0.4) and rose to 19.2 (95% CI 6.08-60.2), 11.02 (95% CI: 5.41-22.02) at survey rounds 1 and 2 and stabilized at 6.11 (95% CI: 4.32-8.62, p<0.0001) at survey round 4 (Table\u2009 4).",
            "Sub-analysis: prompt treatment of patients less than 5 years old",
            "A sub-analysis, focusing on patients less than five years old, included 1,726 observations in the final evaluation survey.",
            "There was very strong evidence that children under five years old in the intervention districts experienced 10 times the odds (95% CI: 4.96-18.86, adjusted Wald test p<0.001) of receiving ACT within 24 hours of symptom onset compared to children in the control district.",
            "The survey-adjusted proportion of children receiving prompt and effective treatment in the intervention district was 18% (95% CI: 14.9-20.8%) compared to 2% (95% CI: 0.8-3.6) in the control district.",
            "Sub-analysis: predictors of ACT uptake in intervention districts",
            "This sub-analysis of intervention districts included 3,965 observations.",
            "Six variables were associated with uptake of ACT in these districts (Table\u2009 5).",
            "Encouragingly, ACT purchasers exhibited three times the odds of citing \u201cdrug price\u201d as the primary reason for purchasing their medicine relative to non-ACT purchasers (6% vs. 2.5%; p<0.001).",
            "Further, the proportion of ACT purchasers indicating that they felt the medicine they purchased was affordable or very affordable was 61% (95% CI: 56.8-64.3%) and 25% (95% CI: 20.9-28.7%), respectively.",
            "In contrast, the proportion of non-ACT users saying the same was 35% (95% CI: 33.0-37.4%) and 8% (95% CI: 6.6-9.1%).",
            "There was insufficient evidence that this perception of ACT affordability was heterogeneous by SES level (p=0.08).",
            "Moreover, children under five years old were more likely to have ACT purchased on their behalf than patients aged five years or older (29% vs. 25%; OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.17-1.64; p<0.001).",
            "However, members of the highest SES stratum exhibited 2.4 times (95% CI: 1.72-3.35; p<0.001) the odds of ACT use compared to the lowest stratum.",
            "Additionally, respondents purchasing medicine 24 to 48 hours after the onset of the patient\u2019s fever were more likely to buy ACT than those purchasing drugs within 24 hours (30% vs. 25%; OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.10-1.70; p=0.004) (Table\u2009 5).",
            "Secondary analysis: sub-optimal anti-malarial use at baseline and final survey round",
            "Of 1,173 observations in the baseline data, 1,168 were subjected to analysis.",
            "This investigation found that there were no notable associations between prospective intervention status and use of SP or ACT.",
            "However, this analysis did uncover weak but not significant evidence that the intervention districts experienced less quinine use relative to the control district (37% vs. 44%; OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.53-1.08, p=0.1).",
            "ACT with a leaf uptake in the intervention districts",
            "By the end of the pilot study, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d accounted for 69% of all anti-malarials purchased at licensed drug shops to treat malaria in the under-five year old age group in the four intervention districts (Figure\u2009 4).",
            "In line with national regulations, \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d was not sold to unlicensed drug shops; however, the product leaked to some outlets, resulting in 14% of the caregivers of children visiting unlicensed outlets receiving \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d.",
            "The share of subsidized ACT among all anti-malarials purchased dropped in September 2009 as demand outstripped supplies, resulting in stock-outs.",
            "This was itself largely due to the knock-on effect of protracted public sector ACT stock-outs, resulting in virtually all access to ACT in the intervention areas being through the private sector.",
            "This also increased the share of quinine sales from licensed drug shops and chloroquine sales in unlicensed outlets.",
            "Low price made \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d the medicine of choice",
            "The subsidy brought the price of ACT in line with that of chloroquine and a full course of a child\u2019s treatment was lower than that for quinine (Figure\u2009 5A).",
            "The subsidy along with a good communication campiaign was highly successful in ensuring that the maximum recommended retail price (MRRP per tablet: UGX 33) was respected, particularly in licensed outlets, with the mean price varying within a 10 percent band (Figure\u2009 5B).",
            "Most children received the right dose",
            "Over 80% of caregivers of children under five (except in Pallisa) purchased the correct number of tablets at the right price.",
            "Knowledge of the correct dosing varied: about 70% of caregivers knew the correct number of tablets per dose and over 80% knew that the dose should be given twice a day for three days.",
            "The level of knowledge in Budaka was higher than the other districts.",
            "The composite indicator across all intervention districts for the appropriateness of the treatment administered was 71%, with the lowest score of 65% in Pallisa and the highest of 89% in Budaka (Figure\u2009 6).",
            "Discussion",
            "The CAPSS pilot study was successful in demonstrating that a subsidized product coupled with an intensive communication campaign leads to increased purchase and use of ACT in the private sector.",
            "There was a six-fold increase in the number of people (all age groups) and a ten-fold increase in children under five years old purchasing effective malaria treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever.",
            "Further, over 70% of the caregivers who purchased an ACT complied with recommended treatment schedules.",
            "All the objectives set at the outset were thus achieved.",
            "The CAPSS pilot study validates the hypothesis that affordable treatment drives availability and uptake, thereby displacing ineffective treatments, and provides evidence to support the AMFm concept.",
            "The preliminary findings from the CAPSS pilot study were shared with the AMFm task force in 2010 and provided the rationale for using the universal logo for all AMFm products  - the CAPSS logo of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d was chosen as the AMFm product logo (\u201cACTm with a leaf\u201d).",
            "We believe the effect sizes we observed between the intervention and control areas are statistically modest compared to what could have reasonably been expected.",
            "There are two reasons for this.",
            "First, the overall ACT availability in public health facilities in the control district (Soroti) improved greatly, with three-quarters of facilities having ACT in stock in May 2010 [Uganda HMIS reports].",
            "The contextual information suggests that there was better availability of ACT in the public sector in the control district because of improvements that had been made in the procurement and distribution system, based on a push instead of a pull system for the lower-level health units.",
            "However, this was not the case in the intervention districts.",
            "Consequently, slightly more than half of the public health facilities in Pallisa and Kaliro had no public sector ACT packs in stock at the time of the surveys; and the situation in Budaka was distressingly inadequate, with three quarters of public sector facilities having no ACT in stock.",
            "Second, the intervention made by another group (Living Goods) to improve access to ACT at community level in the control district had an impact on ACT supply there.",
            "These findings make us believe that the effect differences could have been bigger had these developments not taken place or had the public sector supply chain not failed in the intervention districts.",
            "The private sector\u2019s role in ensuring access to medicines is largely complementary to that of the public sector: the nature of this role is determined primarily by the level of availability in public sector outlets.",
            "When there are stock-outs in the public sector, the private sector\u2019s role inevitably shifts from a complementary one to primary.",
            "Whether the private sector played a complementary or primary role therefore varied greatly during the different rounds of data collection.",
            "For example, in Kaliro, Pallisa and Budaka, access to ACT was largely assured through the availability of the subsidized ACT in the private sector, because stock-outs in the public sector were very frequent.",
            "However, in Kamuli, private sector availability complemented existing public sector availability.",
            "ACT access through the private sector was very low in the control district.",
            "Based on these findings, we believe that moving forward; the AMFm strategy should be tailored to the local context .",
            "There are settings where strengthening the public sector can achieve substantial improvements in access to malaria treatment.",
            "However, in settings like Uganda, strengthening the public sector without providing complementary support from the private sector is very unlikely to achieve the WHO Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP) case management access target that 80% of patients should receive treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset .",
            "While the CAPPS pilot study was very successful, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure adequate availability in poor and remote rural areas.",
            "This requires a number of specific actions, such as incentivising suppliers to deliver medicines to such areas, or strengthening community based systems, such as that of Uganda\u2019s village health teams.",
            "Ensuring there are sufficient licensed outlets to meet demand is also critical.",
            "In the more developed areas of Uganda, where private businesses flourish, a sufficiently large number of private outlets are able to achieve the required licensing standards.",
            "However, in other less developed areas, where there are currently few or no private licensed outlets, there is insufficient coverage.",
            "In addition, the outlets that do exist in these areas are often severely constrained, since many of the smaller outlets rely on the immediate cash flow from sales to pay for their next orders.",
            "These cash flow constraints result in the smaller outlets placing very small orders with the distributors, since they cannot afford to tie up significant amounts of money in stock.",
            "Prices in the more remote rural areas are often even higher than in urban/suburban centres, largely due to the additional costs of distribution.",
            "Enhancing access to ACTs in poorer, more remote areas requires overcoming these distribution challenges.",
            "A second challenge is the difficulty of maintaining the maximum recommended retail price in the face of currency exchange fluctuations.",
            "The Ugandan Shilling faced ongoing devaluation during the course of this study.",
            "This resulted in the importers of \u201cACT with a leaf\u201d facing higher landed costs, costs which are normally passed on to the consumers in terms of higher prices.",
            "Moreover, national drug regulatory agencies in many countries, particularly in East Africa, do not attempt to control market prices in view of price liberalization policies.",
            "Rather than imposing a maximum price, therefore, a more pragmatic approach might be to issue a \u201crecommended retail price range\u201d (RRPR).",
            "This would be effective in setting price expectations.",
            "The maintenance of the ACT price is also subject to the availability of the continuing subsidy; this price is consequently vulnerable to changes in the global funding landscape.",
            "A third challenge, applying to both the public and private sectors, is the need to avoid stock-outs.",
            "Ensuring uninterrupted availability of ACT is critical to guaranteeing access to effective treatment.",
            "In this regard, the two sectors can work synergistically to improve access to treatment.",
            "A concerted effort needs to be made to ensure that more caregivers of children under five seek treatment within 24 hours of the onset of fever and have access to ACT.",
            "The introduction of rapid diagnostic tests in the public sector and subsequently in the private sector could help ensure targeting of ACT.",
            "Such an approach would ensure that patients quickly get access to the correct treatment for malaria based on parasite-based diagnosis as per current WHO recommendations .",
            "The results of the independent evaluation of the AMFm from Uganda validate the CAPSS findings of affordability driving stocking and uptake as availability of quality assured ACTs (AQ-ACT) across all outlets increased from 21% at baseline to 67% at endline .",
            "The recommended retail price (RRP) however of USD 0.47 for an adult course of treatment was not adhered to; the median price at the endline survey was USD 1.96.",
            "The independent evaluation suggests that this may be influenced by the absence of supporting interventions before the final round of data collection due to delays in the disbursement of the Global Fund grant and the fact that only 10% of respondents knew that there was a RRP and only 5% knew the level.",
            "Certain limitations in the design of this study need to be noted.",
            "First, the districts were purposefully selected and only one district was used as a control.",
            "This could have increased the potential for discordance between the populations included in the study.",
            "Some discordance was observed between the intervention and control districts at baseline in terms of drug consumption habits.",
            "Fortunately, the observed disparities did not include the use of ACT.",
            "Generating survey-adjusted outputs was intended to provide a more reasonable range of likely values that accounted for this prior to executing tests of significance.",
            "Second, only respondents leaving drug outlets at specific times and who consented to the interview were analysed.",
            "This could lead to both a selection and response bias.",
            "Different groups are likely to visit drug stores at different times during the day.",
            "As an example, people who are employed full-time may be more likely to visit an outlet at night.",
            "Also, we did not collect detailed information about potential respondents who refused to be interviewed.",
            "It is possible that their characteristics differed from the study sample.",
            "However, the rate of refusal was generally small (not exceeding 10%) and any effect due to refusal probably did not impact significantly on the outcome measures.",
            "Further, the wide range of times at which interviews were conducted, in combination with survey-adjustment, minimized the influence of these possible biases.",
            "Finally, a possible observer bias could arise from the fact that the interviewers were not blinded to the intervention status of the respondents.",
            "To mitigate this risk, a week long training session was administered prior to each round of data collection to instil strict processes for conducting interviews and to prevent - to the extent possible - deviation from the script.",
            "It is unlikely that this lack of blinding could influence the primary outcome in this study, as it was obligatory for the interviewer to observe and record the details of the actual medicine purchased.",
            "Conclusion",
            "These findings provide evidence that a subsidy high up in the supply chain coupled with an intensive communication campaign leads to increased ACT uptake, making a compelling case for AMFm in Uganda and potentially other African settings with similar private sector use.",
            "The approach will need to be customized by country to respond to specific national access challenges.",
            "The approach adopted has been effective in extending uptake in the most vulnerable category, the youngest segment of the population.",
            "Further, it is reassuring that customers purchase the right dose, consistent with observations reported elsewhere in Uganda .",
            "All of the CAPSS pilot study\u2019s multiple data platforms \u2013 the cross-sectional outlet exit surveys with observation and verification of medicines and audits of all retail outlets and public health facilities - confirm that the subsidy of ACT increases access through the private sector to these life-saving medicines.",

Total number analysed was therefore N = 53. M:F 27:23. Mean (SD) age 50.42 (15.43)Group C (Control/no cell salvage group): N = 55. 5 participants were excluded from the analysis due to cell salvage use (N = 4) or death (N = 1). Total number analysed was therefore N = 50. M:F 24:26. Mean age (SD) 52.53 (15.65)There were no differences between the groups at baseline assessment.\n\n\nInterventions: Group CS (Cell Salvage/intervention group): cell salvage group had shed blood from the wound and mediastina collected in the cell saver reservoir (Haemonetics, USA). A 125 mL collection bowl was used. Residual CPB circuit blood was also collected in the reservoir at completion. Collected blood was filtered, centrifuged, washed and concentrated prior to re-transfusion.

            "In three independent randomisations, 2507 pregnant women were allocated to receive single-dose albendazole or placebo, and praziquantel or placebo; 2016 of their offspring were randomised to receive quarterly single-dose albendazole or placebo from age 15 months to 5 years.",
            "Primary outcomes were post-immunisation recall responses to BCG and tetanus antigens, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia; incidence of eczema was an important secondary outcome.",
            "Analysis was by intention-to-treat.",
            "Of 2345 live births, 1622 (69%) children remained in follow-up at age 5 years.",
            "68% of mothers at enrolment, and 11% of five-year-olds, had helminth infections.",
            "Maternal hookworm and Schistosoma mansoni were effectively treated by albendazole and praziquantel, respectively; and childhood hookworm and Ascaris by quarterly albendazole.",
            "Incidence rates of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 py, respectively.",
            "Albendazole during pregnancy caused an increased rate of eczema in the children (HR 1.58 (95% CI 1.15\u20132.17), p\u200a=\u200a0.005).",
            "Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reduced incidence of clinical malaria (HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.73\u20130.98), p\u200a=\u200a0.03).",
            "There were no consistent effects of the interventions on any other outcome.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Routine use of albendazole in pregnancy may not always be beneficial, even in tropical developing countries.",
            "By contrast, regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control where helminths and malaria are co-endemic.",
            "Given the low helminth prevalence in our children, the effect of albendazole on malaria is likely to be direct.",
            "Trial registration",
            "Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN32849447",
            "Introduction",
            "It has been estimated that 2 billion people are infected with schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) with up to one third of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa affected by STH infections.",
            "Globally, malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia are the commonest causes of morbidity and mortality in childhood, and together they account for nearly 50% of all under-five deaths in Africa.",
            "Tuberculosis incidence is estimated at over 9 million new cases per year, with 1.8 million deaths, and the efficacy of Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunisation against tuberculosis is poor in tropical latitudes.",
            "The geographic overlap between helminths and such important infectious agents has led to the immunologically plausible hypothesis that helminth infections influence the epidemiological patterns of other diseases.",
            "Helminths induce potent type 2 and regulatory immune responses, both of which may oppose the type 1 responses required for protection against other pathogens, or by vaccines, thus increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases either directly, or through diminution of vaccine effectiveness.",
            "Conversely, down-regulation of unwanted inflammatory responses during chronic helminth infection may have benefits.",
            "Contrasting effects of helminths on susceptibility to malaria infection, and on the damaging inflammatory sequelae, may explain in part the conflicting results of previous studies on helminth-malaria interactions, some of which suggest detrimental, and some beneficial, effects.",
            "Benefits may also include the prevention of allergy and autoimmunity, which are rare in tropical, developing countries.",
            "Prenatal exposure to helminths may be particularly important: in utero exposure to maternal helminths has long term implications for the child's response to related worm infections but whether such immunological effects have a measurable impact on efficacy of unrelated vaccines or on incidence of unrelated infectious diseases, and whether these effects may be reversed by the administration of anthelminthics during pregnancy and early childhood, is less clear.",
            "Helminth infections in early childhood may also have important effects on the responses generated as children undergo their initial exposures to infections and allergens.",
            "We established the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study to investigate effects of helminths and their treatment during pregnancy and early childhood on immune responses to vaccines and on susceptibility to infectious and allergy-related diseases in early childhood.",
            "Findings in infancy showed little effect of maternal helminths, or of their treatment during pregnancy, on vaccine and infectious outcomes, but significant adverse effects of maternal anthelminthic treatment on infantile eczema.",
            "We have now investigated the effects of quarterly albendazole versus placebo in preschool children, as well as the longer-term effects to age 5 years of the intervention in pregnancy, on the recall response to BCG and tetanus immunisation given in infancy, on incidence of infectious diseases (malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia) and eczema, and on other outcomes for which anthelminthic therapy has been proposed to be beneficial: anaemia, growth and cognitive development.",
            "Materials and Methods",
            "Study design and participants",
            "As previously described, the study, based at Entebbe General Hospital, Uganda, was a trial with three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventions at two times, in a 2\u00d72(\u00d72) factorial design: women were randomised to albendazole versus placebo and praziquantel versus placebo during pregnancy; their children were randomised to quarterly albendazole versus placebo from age 15 months to 5 years [ISRCTN32849447].",
            "Written informed consent was obtained twice: from the mother during pregnancy, and from the mother or caregiver when the child reached age one year, or the first subsequent visit, for the trial of treatment during childhood.",
            "The study was approved by the Science and Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology and the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.",
            "The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.",
            "Randomisation and masking",
            "Randomisation codes were generated by the trial statistician using Stata version 7 (College Station, Texas, USA), with numbers allocated in blocks of 100 and 80 to the mother and child treatment groups, respectively; all three randomisations were independent of each other.",
            "Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the women, and intervention and randomisation procedures during pregnancy have been described in detail.",
            "Briefly, healthy pregnant women from the study area, and planning to deliver in Entebbe Hospital, pregnant women were assigned in a 1\u22361\u22361\u22361 ratio to receive simultaneously single-dose albendazole (400 mg) and praziquantel (40 mg/kg), or albendazole and a praziquantel-matching placebo, or an albendazole-matching placebo and praziquantel, or an albendazole-matching placebo and a praziquantel-matching placebo (albendazole and matching placebo: GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK; praziquantel tablets, (Medochemie Ltd, Limassol, Cyprus) were used to prepare identical praziquantel 300 mg and placebo capsules (Almedica Europe Ltd, Deeside, UK)).",
            "The intervention was given under direct observation, during the second or third trimester of pregnancy.",
            "When children made their first quarterly visits from age 15 months onwards, they were randomised in a 1\u22361 ratio to receive quarterly albendazole or placebo.",
            "All children of participating mothers were eligible for inclusion.",
            "From age 15 to 21 months, children received syrups (5 ml) equivalent to 200 mg albendazole or matching placebo, labelled according to the randomisation code by the manufacturer.",
            "From age 2 to 5 years, children received chewable tablets of albendazole (400 mg) or matching placebo, packaged and sealed by an independent committee of Medical Research Council staff in Entebbe, not otherwise involved in the study, into consecutively numbered envelopes according to the randomisation code.",
            "Trained study nurses allocated the numbers sequentially and gave the quarterly intervention, observing that it was taken correctly.",
            "All participants and study staff were blinded to the drug allocation throughout the trial.",
            "Procedures",
            "Women provided a single stool sample prior to randomisation and following delivery; all received anthelminthic treatment six weeks after delivery.",
            "Their children were followed up for routine immunisations, and then quarterly, to age 5 years.",
            "Children received BCG and oral polio immunisations at birth, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B immunisations at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, and measles immunisation at 9 months.",
            "At routine annual visits, blood and stool samples were collected, and growth outcomes recorded.",
            "Irrespective of their allocated intervention group, children found to have helminth infections on examination of the annual stool sample were treated as indicated for the species identified.",
            "Primary outcomes were immune response at age 5 years to BCG and tetanus immunisation, and incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and tuberculosis during childhood.",
            "Following evidence from our preliminary study of a possible effect of maternal helminths and of albendazole treatment during pregnancy on infantile eczema, allergy-related disease events were added as an important secondary outcome for the main trial.",
            "Other secondary outcomes were growth and anaemia assessed at routine annual visits, and cognitive development.",
            "We also considered asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia recorded at routine annual visits, as an unplanned exploratory outcome.",
            "Immunological assays were simplified compared to the original protocol, for logistic and cost reasons.",
            "The recall response to vaccines given during infancy was assessed at 5 years using cytokine responses to crude culture filtrate proteins (cCFP) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and antigen 85 (a major secreted protein complex that exhibits cross-reactivity between many mycobacterial species), and to tetanus toxoid, as indicators of response to BCG and tetanus immunisation.",
            "We examined stimulated interferon-\u03b3 (type 1), interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 (type 2), and interleukin-10 (regulatory) responses in a whole-blood assay, as previously described.",
            "Total serum anti-tetanus IgG was measured by ELISA.",
            "Illness outcomes were detected prospectively when sick children were brought to the clinic for treatment.",
            "Malaria was diagnosed as fever (\u226537.5\u00b0C) with any parasitaemia (whether asexual forms or gametocytes); diarrhoea was diagnosed based on the mother's definition; pneumonia was defined as cough with difficulty in breathing, and fast breathing (defined by age), with or without abnormal breath sounds; measles was defined by standard clinical criteria confirmed by measurement of specific antibody; children with suspected tuberculosis were investigated as clinically indicated; eczema was defined as a recurrent itchy rash with either wet, weeping skin or dry, scaly skin, and with a typical distribution.",
            "One study doctor underwent specialised training in the diagnosis of skin conditions at the National Referral and Teaching hospital in Uganda, and trained other doctors at the study clinic, to ensure accurate and consistent definition of eczema.",
            "For development outcomes, children were assessed at age 5 years at the study clinic for cognitive ability, executive function and motor ability using 13 measures created or adapted for the study (see Text S1 and Table S1).",
            "Haemoglobin was estimated by Coulter analyzer (Beckman Coulter AC-T 5 diff CP; Beckman Coulter, Nyon, Switzerland).",
            "Leishman stained thick blood films were examined for P. falciparum ring forms or gametocytes.",
            "The modified Knott's method was used to examine for microfilariae.",
            "Stools were examined for helminth ova using the Kato-Katz method: two slides were prepared from each sample; slides were read within 30 minutes for hookworm ova, and the following day for other species.",
            "Stools were cultured for Strongyloides.",
            "Urine examination for S. haematobium was not conducted because it is rare in this setting.",
            "Quality control for haematology and malaria parasitology was provided through the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Schemes, and for Kato Katz analyses through the Vector Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, Uganda, with consistently good results.",
            "HIV status was determined for mothers at enrolment during pregnancy, and for children aged 18 months or above, using a rapid antibody test algorithm; for infants RNA and DNA polymerase chain reaction methods were used.",
            "Serious adverse events were defined as any clinical event considered by the clinician to be severe or life-threatening, or that resulted in death.",
            "This included events requiring unexpected hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, or resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, but not hospitalisations expected in this setting for illnesses such as malaria.",
            "Pre-specified serious adverse events include miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, major congenital abnormality, maternal death during the puerperium, death of the child at any time and anaphylaxis, severe acute bronchospasm or seizures within 24 hours of administration of the study drug.",
            "Statistical analysis",
            "Data were analysed after all children had reached age 5 years.",
            "Data from routine annual visits were included if the child attended within 1 month before and 2 months after their birthday.",
            "Results for all twins and triplets were included.",
            "All analysis was by intention-to-treat.",
            "The cohort size of 2500 was calculated to give 80% power to detect treatment effect sizes at p<0.05.",
            "For recall responses to immunisation, allowing for anticipated loss to follow-up, samples from 1046 children assessed at 5 years would detect differences in cytokine responses of 0.14 log10 between maternal or childhood intervention groups, assuming a standard deviation of 0.80 log10.",
            "For illness events, a detrimental effect of anthelminthic treatment was anticipated for malaria and eczema, and a beneficial effect for other infections.",
            "For the childhood intervention, estimated effect sizes that could be detected were rate ratios of 1.07, 0.94, 0.81 and 1.30 for malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and eczema, assuming rates in the placebo group of 80, 100, 10 and 5 per 100 person-years, respectively.",
            "The study had power to detect slightly smaller long-term effects of the maternal interventions, since the follow-up time (from birth to 5 years) was longer.",
            "The incidence of both tuberculosis and measles was expected to be low, therefore only very large differences in rates would be detected.",
            "To evaluate the effect of the childhood intervention on the prevalence of each helminth, we combined data from all annual visits, examining the overall effect of each treatment using generalised estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) allowing for within-child correlations.",
            "Cytokine and antibody responses showed skewed distributions, some with disproportionate numbers of zero values.",
            "Results were transformed to log10(concentration+1) and analysed by linear regression with bootstrapping to estimate bias-corrected accelerated confidence intervals.",
            "Regression coefficients were back-transformed to give geometric mean ratios.",
            "For long-term effects of maternal interventions on incidence of diseases in childhood, time at risk began at birth.",
            "For effects of the childhood intervention, sample size calculations assumed time at risk from age 1 to 5 years.",
            "However, recognising that the intervention actually commenced when the child took the first intervention dose, the analysis plan was modified such that time at risk began at the date of randomisation and receipt of the first dose (age 15 months, or later if the child missed the 15-month visit).",
            "For both analyses, time at risk was censored at loss to follow-up, death or age 5 years.",
            "All children were included until censoring, regardless of whether or not they had made a clinic visit for illness.",
            "For each disease, we calculated incidence rates for all events.",
            "Episodes within 14 days of an initial presentation with the disease were considered to be part of the same episode and excluded from the analysis; time at risk was adjusted accordingly.",
            "Hazard ratios (HRs) for the effect of treatment on all-events disease incidence were calculated using Cox regression with robust standard errors to allow for within-child clustering.",
            "The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia at each annual visit was compared between treatment groups using logistic regression.",
            "Sex-specific z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height at 5 years were derived from WHO growth standard reference scales, using WHO Anthro version 3 for children measured when aged less than 5 years and 1 month and WHO AnthroPlus version 3 for children who were measured more than 1 month (and less than 2 months) after their fifth birthday.",
            "We examined the effects of the interventions on the continuous z-scores and on haemoglobin at each annual visit using linear regression.",
            "We also combined data from all annual visits, examining the overall effect of each treatment using GEE linear regression models to allow for within-child correlations.",
            "Effects of the interventions on tests of motor and cognitive functioning at 5 years were examined using linear regression.",
            "For the maternal interventions, two pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed, examining effects of albendazole treatment in children of mothers with hookworm infection, and effects of praziquantel treatment in children of mothers with schistosomiasis.",
            "Differences between subgroups were examined by fitting interaction terms in regression models.",
            "For the childhood intervention we conducted a post-hoc subgroup analysis of malaria incidence by age group, fitting an interaction term to test for effect modification.",
            "Interactions between the childhood intervention and each maternal intervention were also examined by fitting interaction terms in the regression models.",
            "All p-values are two-sided with no adjustment made for multiple comparisons.",
            "Data were analysed using Stata version 11, except for developmental scores, for which SPSS version 16.0 was used.",
            "Results",
            "2507 women were enrolled between April 2003 and November 2005.",
            "Their offspring were followed from birth to age 5 years, the planned end of the trial.",
            "There were 2345 live-born children of whom 2016 were later randomised into the childhood intervention trial, with 1622 remaining in follow-up at age 5 years (69%).",
            "The trial profile for the maternal intervention up to the end of infancy has been published previously.",
            "The trial profile for the childhood intervention is shown in Figure 1; follow-up was slightly lower in the albendazole group compared to the placebo group with numbers of children still under follow-up at 5 years of 792 and 830, respectively.",
            "Baseline characteristics were comparable between the four treatment groups in pregnancy (Table S2), and between the two treatment groups in childhood, with the exceptions that maternal hookworm was slightly less prevalent, and eczema prior to the childhood intervention slightly commoner, among children allocated to quarterly albendazole than among those allocated to placebo (Tables 1 and 2).",
            "Mothers of children who participated in the childhood intervention were on average slightly older, less likely to be primigravidae, and less likely to have asymptomatic P. falciparum infection than mothers of children who did not participate; children who participated were on average heavier at birth, and less likely to be HIV positive or to have asymptomatic P. falciparum at one year of age than those who did not.",
            "There was no evidence of interaction between maternal and childhood treatments for any outcome, therefore the effects of each treatment were examined independently.",
            "Following the childhood randomisation, adherence was slightly lower in the albendazole group than in the placebo group, reflecting the slightly lower follow-up in the albendazole group: mean (SD) doses received (of a maximum of 16) was 11.8 (4.5) for placebo versus 11.4 (4.1) for albendazole, p\u200a=\u200a0.08; 22% versus 19% of participants received all 16 doses, respectively (p\u200a=\u200a0.05).",
            "At each annual visit, between 20% and 30% of children were reported to have received anthelminthic treatment elsewhere.",
            "Over the four years of the childhood trial, 81% of those in the placebo group and 83% of those in the albendazole group reported receiving anthelminthic treatment elsewhere at least once.",
            "At enrolment, 68% of women were infected with at least one helminth species, but prevalence was low among children at all annual visits: 3.6%. 5.6%. 8.9%. 11.0% and 10.5% at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively..",
            "At age 5 years, 5.5% of children were infected with Trichuris trichiura, 2.3% with Schistosoma mansoni, 1.1% with Ascaris lumbricoides, 1.0% with Hymenolepis nana, 0.5% with hookworm, and 0.2% with Mansonella perstans (Table S3).",
            "Combining data from all annual visits, the childhood intervention was associated with a reduction in prevalence of A. lumbricoides and hookworm (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.71, p\u200a=\u200a0.001 and OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.96, p\u200a=\u200a0.04, respectively) but no other helminth infection was affected (Table 3).",
            "At age 5 years cytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens were assessed among 1190 children who had received BCG immunisation at Entebbe Hospital.",
            "Cytokine and antibody responses to tetanus toxoid were assessed, respectively, among 1162 and 1129 children who had received all three doses of tetanus immunisation.",
            "The proportion of children for whom positive responses to cCFP, antigen 85 and tetanus toxoid were detected varied by cytokine: for cCFP, 86%, 48%, 71% and 90% of infants had positive responses to IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10, respectively.",
            "Corresponding numbers for antigen 85 were 76%, 40%, 63% and 81%, respectively, and for tetanus toxoid the figures were 39%, 39%, 60% and 52%, respectively.",
            "There was no effect of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy on these responses, either overall, or in the pre-specified sub-group analyses (data not shown).",
            "Quarterly treatment with albendazole was associated with somewhat lower IFN- \u03b3, IL-5 and IL-13 responses to cCFP (with strongest effects for IFN- \u03b3 and IL-13), but no similar effect was seen on responses to antigen 85 or to tetanus toxoid, and there was no effect on anti-tetanus antibody levels (Table 4).",
            "From birth to 5 years, a total of 33,178 clinic visits for illness were made; numbers of visits were similar across both maternal and childhood treatment groups (data not shown).",
            "All-event incidence rates for malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and eczema were 34, 65, 10 and 5 per 100 person-years, respectively.",
            "Measles and tuberculosis were very rare in the cohort with only 1 and 4 episodes observed, respectively, so it was not possible to evaluate the impact of anthelminthic treatment on incidence of these diseases.",

            "One child developed severe malaria within three days of receiving their first dose of albendazole at age 17 months, and died 6 weeks later following complications from this illness event, but there was no suggestion of a consistent effect of the childhood intervention on mortality: only 16 deaths occurred after the childhood randomisation, 8 in the placebo group and 8 in the albendazole group.",
            "Discussion",
            "In Entebbe, Uganda, where helminth prevalence was high among pregnant women, we addressed the effects of treatment with albendazole and praziquantel during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy on outcomes from birth to 5 years.",
            "We found no substantial effect of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy on the child's response to immunogens, on infectious disease incidence, or on anaemia, growth, motor or cognitive development, to age 5 years.",
            "By contrast, treatment with albendazole during pregnancy had an adverse effect on the incidence of eczema in childhood.",
            "These longer-term results accord with our findings in infancy.",
            "Helminth infection prevalence was unexpectedly low during early childhood, and this limited our ability to assess the effects of the childhood intervention against them.",
            "However, we found that quarterly albendazole from age 15 months to 5 years reduced malaria incidence, with strongest effect between age 15 months and 2 years.",
            "Many studies on the effects of helminths and their treatment are flawed due to bias and confounding, because of strong associations between helminth infections and poverty, deprivation and poor health care.",
            "A strength of this study was its randomised, placebo-controlled design, which resulted in the balanced distribution of many potential confounding factors between the treatment arms.",
            "Helminth prevalence during pregnancy was high: the detection of at least one species among 68% of women using a single stool sample implies that almost all women were infected.",
            "By contrast, the low prevalence of helminth infection among children was our chief limitation.",
            "For ethical reasons, effective treatment was provided annually to children found to be helminth-infected; therefore annual prevalence figures represent not cumulative infection since birth, but cumulative incidence since the most recent treatment.",
            "Although quarterly albendazole reduced infection rates with Ascaris and hookworm, the numbers infected were so small that any consequence of this reduction would have had to have been very strong to be detected in this study.",
            "Questions as to the effects of helminth infection and their regular treatment in preschool children therefore remain unanswered.",
            "A possible bias is suggested by the somewhat higher uptake of the childhood intervention by children receiving placebo, compared to those receiving active drug.",
            "However, we had no evidence that either staff or participants had inadvertently been unblinded to treatment allocation.",
            "Mothers of children who participated in the childhood intervention differed from mothers of children who did not.",
            "This is unlikely to have biased our treatment effect estimates since characteristics of participants were balanced between treatment groups.",
            "However it may have reduced our power to detect effects of anthelminthic treatment since the participants who were lost tended to have higher prevalence of some helminths, and could have some implications for generalisability since children who participated in the childhood intervention were on average from slightly more well-off families within the study setting.",
            "We examined the effects of three interventions, each on multiple outcomes; all analyses except for one exploratory outcome (asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia) were pre-specified, however the possibility that our positive findings are due to chance alone cannot be discounted.",
            "Rather than formally adjusting for multiple testing we interpret consistent results for related outcomes as providing stronger evidence of a true treatment effect.",
            "In keeping with results in infancy, we found no effect of maternal anthelminthic treatment on recall responses to vaccine antigens at age 5 years.",
            "Quarterly albendazole during childhood was associated with reductions in type one and type two immune responses to cCFP, but this was contrary to the predicted effect of removing either worms or malaria and was not reflected by responses to antigen 85, so these rather weak effects may have arisen by chance.",
            "We have previously reported that albendazole treatment during pregnancy was associated with increased incidence of infantile eczema, while praziquantel was associated with increased infantile eczema among the offspring of mothers with schistosomiasis, and that infantile eczema was associated with skin prick test positivity to common allergens in this cohort.",
            "Eczema incidence declined, as expected, after infancy and we now show that the incidence of newly diagnosed eczema after age 1 year was similar between maternal treatment groups: thus the principal impact of maternal albendazole was in infancy.",
            "The effect of praziquantel treatment during pregnancy among infants of mothers with schistosomiasis waned with the longer follow-up period.",
            "Eczema in infancy, however, remained a strong predictor of subsequent episodes, and the long term impact of intrauterine exposure on allergy-related outcomes such as asthma remains to be determined.",
            "The effect of maternal albendazole was as strong among children of women without hookworm (and indeed among women without any helminth infection) as among children of hookworm-infected women, implying a mechanism involving effects on other organisms (such as malaria, as discussed below), or a direct effect on the developing immune system.",
            "The lack of effect of our childhood intervention on eczema \u2013 unintentionally tested largely in the absence of helminths \u2013 suggests that this adverse effect of albendazole was confined to the prenatal period, in keeping with studies suggesting that prenatal exposures are critical in the programming of allergy-related disease.",
            "Given the low prevalence of helminths in childhood, we were surprised by the effect of childhood albendazole on malaria incidence.",
            "This seems unlikely to be a chance finding, because illness events and asymptomatic parasitaemia showed the same pattern.",
            "Direct inhibition of malaria by benzimidazoles, including albendazole, has been demonstrated in vitro, but effects in vivo differ between animal models.",
            "The effect was predominantly seen between age 1 and 2 years, in the vulnerable period when maternal immunity has waned and individual immunity has not yet been established: but this does not accord with the general experience that antimalarial drugs have greater benefit among individuals with good immunity than among those with poor immunity.",
            "Thus the potential contribution of regular albendazole treatment to the control of malaria in young children merits further investigation in trials designed with this as the primary outcome.",
            "The observed effect of childhood albendazole on malaria also has implications for the interpretation of other studies addressing effects of benzimidazole anthelminthics on growth, anaemia and mortality: outcomes for which malaria is likely to have a more potent impact than helminths.",
            "For example, Alderman and colleagues found benefits of albendazole for growth when given to preschool children on child health days in malaria-endemic regions of Uganda.",
            "Similarly, the findings complicate the interpretation of trials intended to assess the immunological effects of removing helminths on susceptibility to malaria, such as that recently reported from Nigeria, in which regular provision of albendazole in preschool children reduced the prevalence of Ascaris and attenuated the increase in malaria prevalence that occurred over time.",
            "Our findings raise concerns regarding the policy of routine \u201cdeworming\u201d with albendazole during pregnancy in developing countries.",
            "Our study commenced in a setting of high helminth prevalence, but low intensity.",
            "This picture has changed rapidly in Entebbe, as in many towns across sub-Saharan Africa, with rapid development and urbanisation over the last two decades: over 30% of Africans are now estimated to be \u201cmiddle class\u201d.",
            "These demographic changes are accompanied by epidemiological transition with non-communicable diseases, including allergy-related conditions, emerging as important health issues.",
            "While routine anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy may be acceptable in rural settings where hookworm infection is still high, we believe it should be avoided in urban settings where helminth infections are now low.",
            "Conversely, we found no statistically significant adverse effect of albendazole in preschool children, and large controlled trials suggest little impact of routine anthelminthic treatment among school children on allergy-related disease, so it seems reasonable for on-going mass treatment of worms to continue in these age groups, even as helminth prevalence becomes marginal.",
            "Regular albendazole treatment in preschool children may have an additional benefit for malaria control, especially in areas where helminths and malaria are co-endemic, and where IPTi is hampered because SP resistance is high.",
            "Flow of participants through the childhood trial.",
